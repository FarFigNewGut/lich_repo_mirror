5167 [[Reshalia Trade Road, Gravel Pit]]  (u)
  added description: A huge black pit opens up in the ground to the southeast side of the road.  It's too dark to tell how deep it might be, but the vast, gaping maw might well go all the way down to the home of the world dragon, or so it seems.

5168 [[Reshalia Trade Road, Gravel Pit]]  (u)
  added description: This lonely piece of road runs between a thin stretch of wood to the northwest and a dark, wide hole in the ground to the southeast.  Ominous sounds come from both sides of the track, rustling and calling, with an occasional spine-shivering howl from the woods, and rattling and scrabbling sounds from the pit.  Neither is terribly comforting on a cold, dark night.
