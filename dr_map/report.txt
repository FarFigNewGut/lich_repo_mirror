2176 [[Old Crank's Road, Forest]]  (u)
  added description: Light filtering through the branches casts a hazy, warm glow to all it touches, from the snake-like moss roped around the trees to the new shoots of vegetation pushing up through the moist soil at the edge of the road.  Staggered puddles of water fill the deep wheel gashes slashed into the trail.  As each wagon passes, the puddle configuration changes, as the waters mingle and advance down slope toward the marshland.
