5170 [[Reshalia Trade Road, Gravel Pit]]  (u)
  added description: A dark pit opens up on the southeast side of the road.  It's impossible to tell how deep it is, but in the darkness of the night it looks bottomless.  The road runs perilously near the edge of the pit, and understandably most of the wheel ruts crowd the opposite side of the track, which runs near a wooded area.
