3993 [[Great Salt Road, Road to Hibarnhvidar]]  (u)
  added description: Sparsely scattered shrubs alongside the road direct it to a large forest of towering evergreens.  The air is crisp from the elevation, causing the tips of the highest tree branches to remain a frosty white, even during the summer months.  A small turnout made of a single large stone offers room for travelers to step aside for a brief rest before continuing on.  A ring of stones, blackened but clean, sits near the turnout, providing a safe place for a fire to fight the chill.
