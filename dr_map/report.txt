3207 [[Baronial Tournament Arena, Arcade]]  (u)
  added description: Under the cloak of night, stray footfalls of a lone guard on patrol break the eerie silence before fading as he walks toward Theren Keep.  Evening light reflects off fragments of silver lacing the granite cobblestones that pave the road passing beneath the majestic alabaster arch, creating a curiously illuminated path to the fields of competition.

3209 [[Baronial Tournament Arena, Arcade]]  (u)
  added description: Off in the distance flickering lights dance through the darkness of night, casting shadows that appear to breathe life into the white stone of a large alabaster statue that rises up from its hedged corral.  Watered down after the day's activities, the aroma of the practice field's dampened soil intermingles with the lush scent of pine, creating an earthy perfume that wafts through the cooled evening air.
--------------------------------------------------
3210 [[Baronial Tournament Arena, Practice Field]]  (u)
  added description: Well-beaten dirt paths still damp from the evening's cleaning routine encircle the field, flowing in an oft-traveled route between fence, pole, wall and post.  Angled slightly from its most recent attack, a battered quintain dressed to resemble a rather tipsy looking marauder stands in the middle of the course awaiting the next day's activities.  The shadowy outline of neatly trimmed hedges hems the edge of the field.
--------------------------------------------------
3211 [[Baronial Tournament Arena, Archery Practice Field]]  (u)
  added description: Rough-hewn poles form a tall stockade fence that surrounds the field, keeping curious nocturnal animals who may wander in search of food from the adjoining woods safely outside its boundaries.  Torches from the nearby competition range cast a soft flickering light that dances across the ground like playful fairies in the darkness of night.  Peeking through the shadows is a wooden table surrounded by what appears to be a ring of low growing stools, smelling faintly of pine in the cool evening air.
--------------------------------------------------
3212 [[Baronial Tournament Arena, Arcade]]  (u)
  added description: Standing guard through the evening, a pair of tall steel braziers contain blazing fires that wage war against the darkness.  Crickets hide from view, forming an audience that cheers on a battle between night's nocturnal veil and the raging sword-like flames determined to defeat it.  Shadows dance between a wide wooden arch leading to the royal gallery and a dimly lit tent, where overworked pages socialize while they finish off chores assigned to them by their champions.

3213 [[Baronial Tournament Arena, Jousting Field of Honor]]  (u)
  added description: The occasional call of a lonesome owl breaks the stillness of night as flames from tall braziers at the field's entrance cast a formidable shadow over the double fences of the jousting lists.  Stray ribbons flutter and tumble across the ground, their once vivid colors now pale reminders of the day's victories.  Young squires pass silently through the darkened field gathering up the few discarded lances that are repairable before shuffling toward the armory with their night's workload tucked under one arm.
