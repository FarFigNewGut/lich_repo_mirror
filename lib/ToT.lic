This script will play Trick or Treat.

 Step 1:  Purchase a candy bag at [In The Bag, Entry - 31584].
 Step 2:  Make sure your variables are configured.
 - ;vars set keepsack=container (The container where your goodies will be stored - backpack, cloak, etc)
 - ;vars set questsack=container (The container where your voucher booklets are stored - backpack, cloak, etc)

    Uses ;BIGSHOT QUICK for hunting logic. So make sure your bigshot is setup correctly.
        Hunting Tab:
        valid targets = (?:.*)
        quickhunt targets = (?:.*)
        active hunting scripts = signore, isigns, etc.
        society abilities/spells/cmans = etc.
        This script DOES use the loot script field, input something like = eloot/sloot
        
        Commands Tab:
        Fill these boxes with how you want it to attack
        hunting commands(a): = 917 target(m17), attack target(x20), etc.
        ** quick hunting commands: 917 target(m17), attack target(x20), etc.
        Set everything else up with how you want it.
        
        Start the script with your combat gear in your hands, or with empty hands and it will use GIRD.

 Step 3:  ;tot at room #31980
 Step 4:  profit
