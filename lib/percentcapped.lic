=begin

Handy little script to tell you how close to being capped, or to the next tuple of being capped you are.  Useful for anyone, just run it add it to autostart.
Information should auto display when you type "exp" in game, along with the rest of your normal exp info.

Updated for Ascension by Tysong!

Added more Tuple's beyond 10!
