=begin
modified version of my child2 script, which is a modified version of Catrania's original child script.
basically escorts a sunfist official to nearest outpost, and uses disabling magic on any critters encountered unless there's another player present

USAGE:  once you've gotten outside the warcamp with the official, type ;rescue-  (for short)

update history
03/28  - i noticed sometimes it was prepping ewave when only the official was present so these 'false positives' should be fixed now

to do  - do not prep disabler when companion/familiar/etc the only other npc present....might be too hard to account for all of these
