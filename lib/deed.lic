Landing, Ta'Illistim, and River's Rest deed script.

It will take you to the proper room but not return you
to the starting point.

It only uses gems and it only gets one deed at a time.
Usage is ;deed <gem1> <gem2> <gem3>...
It assumes the gems are on you and in an open container.

It will allow you to use coins in the Landing.

If you would like to know how many silvers you need for deeds,
or the minimum required value gems need to be, usage is
;deed calculate. This value is only as accurate as the
formula, which is 100 + 100(level + deeds) (divided by three
for gems).

04/8/2010-- Fixed a bug in Ta'Illistim.
