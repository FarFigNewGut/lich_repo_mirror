So begins my rewrite of the gems2deeds script originally by Samrit.
Many kudos to him for the original and the idea to expand this. I will still be using
his original gem appraise routine and most of the original routine for the Landing, in addition
to the gem picking routine per deed. I feel why not use what works.
	Thanks, Samrit! Not sure if you're still around in some form, but shout out if you are!

	And thanks to the scripting community for the help learning everything I've learned so far, you
	guys all rock! (Doug, Falicor, Naijin, Steeltalon, among others)

Setup:  Make sure to use ;vars setup OR ;vars set gemsack=<container> to set your gem container
				before first use
				You could also use ;exec UserVars.gemsack = 'container'
				Once the gemsack is set in vars, then:
				
Usage: ;gemdeeds

Will automatically take you to the closest deed puzzle and get you as many deeds as the gems
in the specified sack will obtain. (still tweaking gem values per puzzle, so might be less deeds than
you expect). TODO: Implement a var to declare what YOU think each gem should be worth? Maybe per town?
TODO: if implementing multiple town gem worth vars, possibly bring online a gui...


Goals - To have one comprehensive deeds script that will use gems(including scarabs)
				to get deeds at all deed locations. Including modifying gem worth dependant
				on location, hopefully.

Needs - all primary deed room ids(for ones with doors the room outside the door?)
				and comprehensive deed obtaining logs

	1.a1 - alpha still, not done, but a few fixes.
	1.a - alpha version - will include Whenimer's Landing and Ta'Vaalor to begin. And here we go!

#							Also maybe allow for a var to determine how much a gem is
