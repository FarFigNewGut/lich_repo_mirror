=begin
	Backroom access script
	Because I'm sick of people asking for it...
	I'm also sick of doing a command line script for it
	So... directions are...    ;backroom #    where # is the # of the item you want to buy
	(Item should be least expensive item in the shop)
	Must start script with empty hands.
	Must have coins on you to afford 100 of the item you're intending to purchase to get backroom access
	If script fails, you can enter a second script variable to purchase a specific number of the item...
	Secondary usage is...   ;backroom <item number>  <amount to buy>   (;backroom 1 25) to buy 25 of item #1
