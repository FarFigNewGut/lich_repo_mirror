=begin
  A helper script for waggle to add meditation support.

  When necessary, it will pause waggle and meditate to recover mana more quickly.
  
  It can be run by itself, in which case it will automatically start waggle, or 
  can be invoked at any point when waggle is already running.

  waggle.lic is required.
