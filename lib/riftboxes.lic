=begin
Assists with looting Rift Boxes from the pool by going to the gemshop and attempting to sell the contents of the box if it won't empty.
Will also attempt to automatically deposit coins and run ';sloot sell' if you get fully encumbered while running poolparty, then resume poolparty when finished. 
Requires: ;sloot and ;poolparty
Usage: ;riftboxes or ;autostart add --global riftboxes
