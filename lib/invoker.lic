  Runs continuously and notifies you when the invoker has returned.
  If you are already in the park it will use them automatically.
  Note: Once it prompts you if you would like to use them,
  the script will not do so automatically if you move in to the room.

  Changelog:
    1.3 (4/26/2021):
      Added auto-use if in Park room. Removed room customization from command line as the invoker only ever shows up in one place. If you need to change it you can still change the invoker_location variable at the top of the script, but I prefer simplicity where possible :)
    1.1 (4/24/2021):
      Added colorized text for stormfront UI
