This is the master of the Open Seas Adventure Companion Scripts. Run this script anytime you wish to perform tasks on your ship.
To use this script you currently need to have downloaded osanav.lic, damagecontrol.lic and gunnersmate.lic
If you do not have them, the script will prompt you for downloading them.
Enjoy
