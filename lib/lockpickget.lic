Allows you to get lockpicks based on materials rather than colors or whatever happens to be the first word in the short description.
I've further aliased the script to lg for my rogue character via: ;alias add lg=;lockpickget

So now I can type this:
LG MITHRIL
Then this script will pull the first item in my toolkit with "mithril" anywhere in the name.

toolkit = GameObj.inv.find{|item| item.name =~ /toolkit/}


if toolkit != nil
	pick = toolkit.contents.find{|i| i.name =~ /#{script.vars[0]}/}
else
	respond "No toolkit found in your inventory."
	exit
end
if pick != nil
	put "get ##{pick.id}"
else
	respond "Nothing found called: #{script.vars[0]}"
end
