this takes yells and cheers from the Arena stands and copies it to the StormFront speech window

please contact Arianiss (Asrial (Arianiss)#1203 / asrialx@gmail.com) for any issues or requests

for a Wizard FE / Avalon version I recommend my speech script that copies not only
this, but speech as well, to the Familiar window (contact me directly for the script)
