#This script will constantly run in the background and will give you a story-line text prompt when your mind changes from unsaturated to saturated or vice-versa.
#As a practical pointer, I often use this script together with ;bountypopup.lic to know when to turn in bounties and when to get new bounties. I add both of these scripts to my ;autostart, and I add the following phrases to my custom highlights: "Your mind is not saturated." and "Your mind is saturated." You can even add a sound notification coupled with those custom string highlights to further notify yourself.
#This script shouldn't need any setting up to work.

loop {
    if check_mind != "saturated"
      echo "Your mind is not saturated."
      wait_until {check_mind == "saturated"}
    elsif check_mind == "saturated"
      echo "Your mind is saturated."
      wait_until {check_mind != "saturated"}
