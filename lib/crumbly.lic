    crumbly.lic: checks for enhancives running out of charges

    This script, when run, will stay in the background and
    check if any worn enhancive (crumbly or permanent) has
    reached a single charge. It checks this in two ways:

    ##########################################################
    WARNING: IF YOU CHANGE THE SCRIPT NAME AWAY FROM 'crumbly'
    YOU MUST UPDATE THE this_script_name VARIABLE BELOW!
    ##########################################################
    
    1. First, it will check for the automatic messages sent by
    the server whenever a worn enhancive reaches a single
    charge. (There are two variants of this message, for hidden
    and non-hidden items, and both are handled.)
    
    2. Second, there is a backup check that consists of issuing
    the "inventory enhancive" command every twnty minutes. This
    command reports if any enhancive has a single charge left.
    This particular check can be disabled by setting the
    "no_crumbly_inv_check" user variable to "false".

    If the script notices an item reaches a single charge, it
    will spam a warning every second that's impossible to ignore.
    You must manually kill the script with ";kill crumbly" then
    you should investigate the situation yourself. If you don't
    kill the script, it will automatically quit your game after
    five minutes.

    Despite its, name, this script does NOT distinguish between
    permanent and crumbly items. (In fact, it cannot.)
    
    (Yes, I have tested this by deliberating running items out
    of charges.)
