	Casts core tap, for use probably with your AFK hunting script
	Lich appears to track multiple charges via earth lore correctly,
	this should work for multiple casts as is.

	Does not check for mana beyond the base 50 cost. 
	Who knows how much this crap is gonna cost you?
	If you wanna blow your nerves go nuts, I 'm not your dad. 

	will change core tap so it auto stances you, you're a wizard.
	if you only use it to cast warding spells and want to stay 
	in defensive:
		;bigtap stance
	(toggles back and forth from true / false)
