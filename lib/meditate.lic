  Forced meditation, via:  
    Casts and eats Manna Bread (if known)
    Starts meditating if you weren't already under its effects
      If the location is unsuitable:
        Cast Minor Sanctuary if known
        Run to town otherwise
    Pauses (almost) all scripts (e.g. ;waggle, ;sheal, ;spellactive will all interrupt you)
    Doesn't let you LOOK (uses LNet self-locate instead) 
    Tells people that interrupt you that you are meditating
    Meditates again if interrupted for any reason
