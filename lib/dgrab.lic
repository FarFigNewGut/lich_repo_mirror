##DGrab,lic, by Dan.  Single command to stow what's in your right hand, grab an item, stow said item, and then get what was in your hand readied again.  Simple, simple script, but comes in handy for those suffering from Psinet withdrawals... To Do list includes sorting the items as they're picked up, but for now this works.

	if script.vars.empty?
		exit
	end
		Right_hand_save = GameObj.right_hand.noun
			multifput "stance def", "stow #{Right_hand_save}", "get #{script.vars[1]}", "stow #{script.vars[1]}", "get #{Right_hand_save}"
		exit
