=begin
  Script for remembering what's in your Astral Vault.
  
  Usage: vault
  
  vault has two modes, depending on the state of your Astral Vault.
  
  * If your vault is currently open, it finds your vault, looks inside, and remembers the contents. (If you are in a group, it will ask you to ensure your groupmates do not have a vault open, because it will get confused if they do.)
  * If your vault is currently closed, it prints the last known contents of your vault.
