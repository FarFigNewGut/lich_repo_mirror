Script to walk officials back to the nearest outpost for Guardians of Sunfist

Start the script as soon as you're inside the Captive's Hut and the official is in front of you.

Unlike ;officialescort, this script automatically finds the room number itself.

Note: Some rooms in the mapdb are specifically designed to work with child2, and official2 may hang or need you to go back one room.

USAGE: ;official2
