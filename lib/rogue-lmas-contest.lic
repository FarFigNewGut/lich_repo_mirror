=begin

Automates those lockpicking contests.
Start the script when you're in front of the footpads.
After each contest, will request another contest 

NOTE: This script will not measure the boxes.  The strategy is to speed pick and win speed points.
NOTE: This script will assume you can disarm these easy traps on the first try.
It will try an alum, then kelyn, then vaalin to pick the boxes.
It will cast 403 if you know it.
If you want to change this strategy, change the "picks" array in the source code.
