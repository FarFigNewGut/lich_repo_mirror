This script will try to cast Major Sanctuary (220) and recast it if/when it fails. It will exit automatically if you leave the sanct by typing "o" or "out". (Thanks to Tysong for the brilliant toggle_upstream code!)

NOTE: If your sanct fails and dumps you into a room full of baddies, it might not be able to recast!

NOTE 2: I tried to use as many of the 220 success/ending messages as possible but if it is not working properly, you might need to add part of your success message to line 33. Also please let me know so I can add it!

I recommend making an alias to use this script by simply typing 220
;alias add --global 220 = ;220
or
;alias add 220 = ;220
