 Title : Instrumentrest
 Date : 07/16/2012
 Author : Oweodry

 Use :
  ;instrumentrest <container> <instrument>

 Details :
  This script plays an instrument while you rest. It has the following features:
  - Waits until your character is at a pre-defined list of nodes before playing
  - Won't trigger when herbheal or useherbs are running

 Notes :
  - No support or future updates are guranteed
  - I'm likely to update the node list if any contributors adhere to my format
  - There are hard-coded variables
  - Sometimes go2 is somtimes so fast and instruments get stowed during climbs
  - Change the first pause timer if you want to play sooner
  - An open left hand is assumed

 Updates :
  - 10/20/2010 Released
  - 07/16/2012 Changed node list to use room tags (uploaded untested)

 Thanks :
  - Your mom
