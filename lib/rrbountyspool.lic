River's Rest Bounty Spooler.

Moves to the Adv Guild and asks about a bounty.  

Player can set (inside the script) any bounties of:
	foraging
	gem
	skinning
	bandits 

Burns a BOOST BOUNTY (if called with spool and it's not the first one) to get a selected bounty.

It presently works in RR, SH and WL.

This is the beta version.  I am still planning to expand the functionality

USAGE: 	;rrbountyspool : checks for one bounty
	;rrbountyspool spool : checks for one bounty, and potentially uses a BOOST and continues checking ad nauseam
	;rrbountyspool stay : let the script leave you at the bounty checkpoint

author: Kaldonis
name: rrbountyspool
tags: RR, bounty
version: 0.40

Version history:
  0.40 Clean-up and overhaul
  0.23 RR didn't have skinning coded correctly
  0.22 Paused before getting bandits
  0.20 Changed for Lich5 (removed goto)
  0.19 Adding bandits for RR and WL (without advguard2)
  0.18 Testing WL gemshop, healer, and furrier
  0.17 bugfix: turning in when saturated was not perfectly coded
  0.16 bugfix: the bounty turn in could accidentally spool past a bounty of interest
  0.15 added ability for it turn a bounty in, and also not turn in when saturated
       make the structure more sane so the regex of interest is not hardcoded twice
  0.14 added the "spool" option, so it doesn't burn a boost by default

Future ambitions (hopes and ideas):
	Choose/decline specific gem/herb/skin
	GUI setup with saving
	More towns
	Pulling gems to accept from your LOCKER MANIFEST <TOWN>
	Getting to FWI lockers!
