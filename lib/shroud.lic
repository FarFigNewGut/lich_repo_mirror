    Shroud of Deception (1212) spell maintainer
	
    This script will automatically re-cast Shroud of Deception AND execute a SHROUD PROFILE 1 command. Right now profile # is hard-coded into the script until I get some more time to expand it.
	
	YOU WILL NEED TO UPDATE YOUR SPELL-LIST.XML FILE!!  The new spell-list-shroud.xml includes the updates from spell-list-demandred and spell-list-barkskin so don't worry - you won't go backwards on that stuff!
	Do this:
	1. ;repo download spell-list-shroud.xml
	2. find that file in your lich folder
	3. re-name that file spell-list.xml
	4. click ok in the dialog box asking for overwrite
	5. reboot lich
