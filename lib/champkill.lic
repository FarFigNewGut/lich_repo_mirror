#Author: Eklectic   stolen/modified from Nylis - modifed to aim for the champions leg first to knock it down
#I made this to deal with warcamps and the Bowels, but it also 
#works great in Duskruin Arena
#the script starts out targeting heads. if you can't reach the
#head or the creature does not have a head the script advances #to right leg and then to left leg and finally to the chest
#as body parts are destroyed.  this was necessary for earth 
#elementals but it comes in handy for arena champions too

#I have done my very best to include language for all status 
#effects such that the scrip will end rather than hang if you 
#are disabled in some unusual way.  It has never hung in the 
#arena, but might hang in another hunting ground

#NOTE - in each section of code begining "line = waitfor" you
#must replace the word maul with the name of your weapon

#because the script cycles through targeting and attempts to 
#target areas that may have already been destroyed you should
#set stormfront to ignore those lines of text to avoid
#crazy screen scroll

#version 2 avoids hanging on failing to find an opening

#you may want to modify or remove the encumbrance check
#depending on your RT situation.  since I ambush with a maul
#even 1 additional second messes me up
