	This script monitors your right hand and left hand to make sure you're carrying your weapon and shield/off hand.

	The following happens if your weapon is not in your right hand or shield/off hand isn't in your left hand:
	Script will kill go2 if it's running.
	Script will tell you which room it thought you were in the last time it saw your weapon or shield in your hands.
	Script will run back to that room if it's not the room you're currently in.
	Script will automatically pick up your weapon and shield if it sees it on the ground in any room.
	Script will attempt to grab your weapon and shield (in one of your containers or on the ground) when it has reached the room it thought you were in when you lost it.

	This script will always attempt to pick up your weapon or shield off the ground for any reason; disarmed, itch curse, you accidentally dropped it, etc.

	Start the script with your weapon in your right hand and your shield/off hand in your left hand.

	Starting the script as ;disarm-no-more <#> will make the script wait X number of seconds before grabbing your weapon/off hand after you stowed it.
	Example: ;disarm-no-more 5 will make the script wait 5 seconds after it sees you stow your weapon/off hand before grabbing it. Script will always grab your weapon/off hand off the ground as soon as it sees it there.

	This script works with bigshot, sloot and loot (waitloot) and will not interfere with their functionality.
