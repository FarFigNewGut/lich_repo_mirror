  A really crappy script to track the last 10 people you healed.
  For the  F2P empath scrubs out there who wait 30 seconds to get shit done.
  It won't track links outside the script usage.
  You gotta heal yourself; all this does is link.

  A fork of my ;raise script. I don't have a F2P empath, so send bugs my way.

  Usage:

  ;link <target>

  ;link add <name>
  ;link reset
  ;link list
