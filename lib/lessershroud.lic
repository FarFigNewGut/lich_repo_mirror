	A basic script to keep lesser shroud (120) cast on specified players,as it drops.
	If the person is not in the room when it drops or when you start the script,
	you'll have to cast it at them manually to restart the loop.
	THIS SCRIPT IS VERY USEFUL FOR ESCORTS OR CHILD BOUNTIES.
	You MUST have 65 ranks of blessings lore for this script to work.
	Usage: ;lessershroud person1 person2 child traveller etc...
