A painted wooden ball floats out of the opening of the polished teak case's hopper and comes to a stop in front of Boring.  A ghostly voice calls out, "O 37" before the ball drifts back into a silver bin located within the polished teak case.  A corresponding rune on the case's callboard lights up with a sickly orange glow.
