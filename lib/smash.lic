Script to perform a stance-danced single ATTACK
For the multiple-attack version, see my script ;fastkill
USAGE: ;smash <noun>
<noun> should be any creature and is option.  Will default to attacking the TARGET (or random)

THIS IS BEST AS AN ALIAS.  YOU CAN ADD IT BY PASTING THIS:
    ;alias add --global smash=;eq waitrt?; multifput "stance off","stance off","attack \?"; sleep 1; waitrt?; fput "stance def"                   

If you use it as an alias, you do not have to prefix 'smash' with semicolon as in ';smash' and you do not need to download this script.

It tries to go into offensive twice since if you spam the command too quickly it may attack in defensive.
