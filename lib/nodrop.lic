    nodrop.lic: disable drag&drop

	Blocks dragging & dropping items onto the ground from
	Stormfront. This is very easy to do if you have links
	turned on. Currently the only way to disable this is
	to turn off links with ALT-L, which is very annoying.
	
	(In the future I may enhance this script with the
	ability to prevent putting items in non-my containers
	or with similar abilities. But for now, this is all
	it does.)
