	This is all Gib's shit from crit_type_tracker.lic (312K, 11-27-2011) except for the extra window part
	DOES NOT WORK IN WIZARD FE
	-Sam
	
	
	VISUAL Crit tracking, for melee, archer, bolting, and CS attacks...  BETA.
	UPDATE:  11-27-2011
	RECENT UPDATE:	acid, unbalance, cold, fire, grapple, lightning, plasma, vaccum (void) crit tables added.
	CURRENTLY BETA...
		Melee:  CRUSH, PUNCTURE, SLASH AND NON-CORP CRITS
		Casting:  ACID, DISINTEGRATE, DISRUPTION, UNBALANCE, COLD, FIRE, GRAPPLE, IMPACT, LIGHTNING, PLASMA, VACCUM (VOID)
		Unfinished:	Steam.
	By Gibreficul, but if you bug me about this script, I'll skullfuck you to death and turn you into hotdogs.
		Information pulled from Krakii's critical tables.
		Used script 702.lic from the repo to add HIDDEN DAMAGE from 702 to the output
		Slated to be added... spell/magic based crit tables.
	Notes:  	I have pulled some information from my own observations.
			unknown damages were likely pulled from 719 crits or weapon flares.
			If any of these unknowns is seen by you, I'll add what I can when I can.
