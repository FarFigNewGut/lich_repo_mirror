Simple script to keep any 1 selfcast spell active
Should work with society stuff assuming you know the Lich spell number for it
By Gibreficul, for those who are too stupid or lazy to make this for themself.
script usage:  ;keep_spell_active ###
=end
spell = script.vars[1]
while true
	wait_until{!Spell[spell].active?}
	Spell[spell].cast
end
