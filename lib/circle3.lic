A boost to maneuver defense for some creature maneuvers. The spell will protect the user from a maneuver if the maneuver is able to be blocked by a shield. For example, soul golems pushing a character into steam vents can be deflected by a shield, so this spell would give the user protection.

The mana cost increases by +1 MP per three (3) additional DS bonus over the base +20.

When self-cast, a character may end the effect with the STOP verb.

Spirit Barrier can be cast on others subject to a warding roll, with duration determined by the warding margin.

Overtraining in Minor Spiritual spell ranks does not yield additional bonus past the caster's level.

Like Spirit Barrier, this is useful in specific instances where you want to lower your risk at the expense of your physical attack odds. Unlike Spirit Barrier, this affects everyone in the room.
If the caster leaves the local area for a while, the spell will dissipate early

Training in Spiritual Lore, Spirit Summoning unlocks an ability at 40 ranks to cause the fog, when cast, to gather around the caster, concealing their form.

It is important for the ranger to know the armor that he or she is casting upon, as attempting this spell on already-resistant armor may result in an unfavorable situation.")

The potions are somewhat volatile, and will lose their effectiveness after a reasonable period of time. It is in the ranger's best interest to use a potion as soon as possible after receiving it from the NPC.")

Failure to do so may result in yet another unfavorable situation.")

Duration: 1800 seconds; refreshable
Type: Defense

Arcane Barrier surrounds its caster in an anti-magic barrier that grants  them immunity to targeted low level offensive spells. The highest spell  level nullified in this manner is based on the caster's Arcane Symbols  or Magic Item Use skill, depending on the method of activation. The  caster becomes immune to spells of level (3 + (caster's ranks/25)) and  lower. For example, a caster with 50 Magic Item Use ranks rubbing a  crystalline prism becomes immune to spells of level 5 and lower.")

respond ("For his own reasons, it has forever been Fash'lo'nae's wish to see knowledge disseminated among the lesser races of Elanthia. Yet this desire was undermined by mortals trying to guard the Grandfather's greatest arcane gift. The specifics of this spell were hidden away in the libraries of Ta'Illistim for centuries, but they have resurfaced. And to make up for lost time, Fash'lo'nae has spread the knowledge of this spell as well as the rest of the Arcane circle across Elanthia like a wildfire.")
respond ("The spell, Fash'lo'nae's Gift, grants ultimate arcane knowledge to the caster. It allows the caster to prepare a spell he would not normally know. The spell must be commonly found on scrolls in the treasure system. The maximum spell level that can be prepared is 5 + (success margin/5). The caster can prepare the spell one time, but gains additional opportunities to prepare it for every 25 success margin beyond the minimum required to prepare the spell.")
respond ("If the caster is able to activate Fash'lo'nae's Gift with extreme success, a 100 success margin beyond the minimum required to prepare the selected spell, the caster can prepare the spell as many times as he desires for 10 minutes. This duration is increased by one minute for every 10 more success margin.")
respond ("For example, if the caster is able to achieve a 120 endroll (success margin = 20) when activating Fash'lo'nae's Gift, he can then prepare a spell of level 9 or lower once (5 + 20/5 = 9).")
respond ("Another example, if the caster can achieve a 210 endroll (success margin = 110), he can prepare any spell level 25 or lower that is commonly available on scrolls, but the number of times he can cast the spell depends on the spell's level. Choosing a spell of level 7 means the caster can prepare it as many times within 10 minutes as he chooses (110 - 10 = 100). Choosing a spell of 17th level means he can prepare it three times (110 - 60 = 50, 1 + 50/25 = 3).")
