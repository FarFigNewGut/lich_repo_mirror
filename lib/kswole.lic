	KSwole
	Automates the use of Feat Absorb and Feat Dispel for Kroderine Soul characters. Will use Mental Dispel (1218) for Mental Acuity characters if affordable when Feat Dispel is on cooldown. Depends on a library of creature spll prep messaging, so if you want this to work in an area not currently supported, send me the creature spell prep language on discord at Nidal#1768 and I'll update it.
	
	Note: There is presently a bug with Kroderine Soul and Mental Acuity which prevents Feat Dispel from working on Powersink (1203), Thought Lash (1210), Confusion (1211), and Vertigo (1219). As and when the bug is fixed, I will update the script to account for them.

	Hunting areas currently supported: Atoll/Nelemar, Hinterwilds, Moonsedge, OTF (incl. Aqueducts), Sanctum of Scales, Scatter.
