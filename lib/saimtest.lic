    SAimTest by SpiffyJr (spiffyjr@gmail.com)
    
    Dumb (logically) script to track your hits, misses, and shots
    using a ranged weapon. If you fail to kill something without swapping
    aiming location the results will be incorrect.
    
    You must swap aiming locations if a wound gets to rank three or you will
    be devaluing your track data!
    
    ;saimtest clear to clear your results and start fresh
