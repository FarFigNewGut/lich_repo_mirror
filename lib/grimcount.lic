=begin
 
Code ripped from ;shroud2 which doesnt exist anymore as far as i can tell.

Will keep track of the count of grim in the camp after every kill.
This applies to you or anyone else in the camp with you.

Has some potential to monitor the shroud activity too. Haven't done anything with that yet.


Run ;grimcount
Sigil of location once when you go in. Then it keeps track after that.

Any questions just let me know:  CaptContagious on PC
