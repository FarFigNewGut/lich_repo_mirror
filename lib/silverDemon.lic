=begin
A crude script to simply give all silvers on you to your demon, intended for use while hunting.
Will also foce your demon to follow you as part of the check to find your demon.
Very under tested beta release.

planned features:
  Chose amount to give, rather than always default to all
  Have the demon give money back to you
    - maybe automatically when in the bank?
