  CMAN Calculator, by Gnomad

  Calculates how good your CMAN/Warrior Guild Skill was.

  This script tells you how successful your feint or disarm was:
  *  Tells you how much RT you inflicted.
  *  Tells you how by how much you changed a target's stance. (for feint)

  Note that -43% stance means that the stance changed by 43 percentage points,
  not that the stance is decreased by 43%. Just subtract, don't multiply.
  
  Stance changes stack.

  Feint calculator became feint timer became CMAN timer. Enjoy!

  changelog:
  0.1:
  made a script that better not fuck up

  0.5:
  Logged on a f2p alt, feinted him 20 times. Why has nobody even looked at this before?
  I worked out the stance percentage mechanics, and it only took 3 feints.
  They were that obvious: endroll - 100, max 100.

  1:
  Added disarm. RT inflicted: 1 second/4 success. Refactored script to better allow for other CMANs.

  2: 
  Added cheapshots
