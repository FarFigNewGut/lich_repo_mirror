    Now everyone can script the trove entry!
    Must have token in your hand ready to drop OR if you had entered previous raffle, it will RETURN 1x to recover 1
    entry from previous raffle. If you entered more than 1x on character, you'll need to adjust script manually.
    Will wait till the raffle pulls and puts next item up, if matches regex, will drop token.
    
    SYNTAX - ;trove <REGEX_STRING>

    Example:
        ;trove an aleteh potion
        ;trove an aleteh potion|a creaky grey leather tome

    changelog:
        1.1 (2019-08-20)
            Added a "RETURN" before trying to drop the token, only tries RETURN 1x
            This is for recovering your token if you had entered the previous raffle.
            If you entered more than one token, you'll need to adjust the script manually to return more than 1x.
        1.0 (2019-08-20)
            Initial release.

A mechanical mithril hand emerges from beneath an open panel and replenishes the empty spot along the shelf with a set of green glaes talons.  A voice calls out, "A new item has gone up for raffle in the Duskruin Warehouse."  The hand selects a polished rolaren breastplate engraved with the symbol of Gosaena from an elaborately carved cabinet and sets it carefully upon a circular tray.

Armor [1]: a polished rolaren breastplate engraved with the symbol of Gosaena
