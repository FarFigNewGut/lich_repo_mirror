Treat your potato right. Run potato.lic at least twice a day!

- It will check your potato's status and try to do whatever it demands.
- Requires betazzherb.lic to find herbs for you.
- Bury: the location list is based on proximity to WL
- Bury: locations are still being found; those that aren't very convenient for WL are currently disabled but will suggest a roomnumber
- Bury: if you don't want the script to do this part, you can set it to false in the UserVars

Send feedback to jeffee83 on Discord!

#The potato appears to be alive, having two eyes and a mouth on its bumpy little body.  Its skin taking on an amber hue and it appears it was last fed a wild carrot.  The potato looks full of energy and indifferent.  It looks #parched.  It looks famished.  Quee has awarded you 1,000 experience over the course of your friendship.  Blue fire radiates from the potato.
