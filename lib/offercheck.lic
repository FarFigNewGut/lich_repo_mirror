  This is a simple script to prevent you from handing ANYTHING but a GEM or a NOTE to another player such as when you are attempting to tip an empath or cleric with a GEM or a NOTE.

  How It Works:
  1. Listens for the offer message format:  
     `"You offer your <item> to <player>, who has 30 seconds to accept the offer."`
  2. Checks if the right-hand item** is a gem or a note.
  3. If the item is not a gem or a note, it issues the **CANCEL** command.
  4. If the item is a gem or a note, the offer continues normally.
