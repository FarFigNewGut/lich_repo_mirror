=begin
Script that will visit all Sunfist outposts to ask about Grimswarm (for rank 5 promotion) except Teras.  Running the Script will provide the important notes you need to know.
It assumes you have already talked to the Grandmaster and received this task.
Feel free to mod and re-upload if you want to improve this...I was reallly bored, and haven't even tested this.
