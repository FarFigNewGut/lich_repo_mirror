# Believe the error that prevented proper operation in the Landing is fixed. Thanks to Daeveran for finding the index issue.

# Invoke this script by typing ;selling safecontainer

# The script puts bank notes in a cloak...you can change that here:

note_storage = "cloak"

# The script will sell armor and weapons (starting with heavier things that might be in your disk)
# Pass it a "safe" container where valuables can go (like "satchel" or "cloak") as in ";selling satchel"
# The safe container should be closable or it's not safe!
# The safe container will put anything that the pawn shop would pay 35K for and recloses the container
# If your container is full though, it might still sell the item (I didn't put in a check for that situation)
# If you're wearing something that's in the sell list, the script will fail (I don't do DR with armor, shield, or weapons
# so I didn't need to put in a check for that for myself.
# If people *really* need to wear their armors and weapons the script can be modified to get items from your containers
# rather than just get items in general.

# UPDATE: I added the ability to trash worthless items. That is called "trash" in Taavalor. If it's not where you are
# then change trash to whatever yours is (barrel?). If you ask me, I'll put that as a variable.

# Note that I don't sell jewelry type items since it'd require specifying the container, you don't get all that many,
# and they are often enhancives people might want even if they aren't selling for the full price.

# item_list is a list of items found in the sewers is in the item_list. If you find something not in the list, you can
# add it by inserting after the last item and before the ]: " ,'new_item'" (without the double quotes).
