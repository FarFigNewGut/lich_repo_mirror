	Ensorcell tracking script
	For tracking gains from ensorcell:  Mana/spirit/health/stamina.
	By Gibreficul... for you ungrateful bastards, (Myself included.)
	NOTES:
		Script will create a log file (found in your Lich directory, in a sub-directory called Logs)
		with the same name as the script's name, but with .log as the extension.  (ensorcell_tracker.log)
		The log will include the character's name, the type of flare, the before, after, and difference of what was boosted by the flare.
		The script ignores the "energized" flare that gives AS/CS/UAF or whatever else that can boost, it only tracks the mana, spirit, stamina, and health flares.
		The script updates the information every second.
		Inaccuracies have already been noted, such as if isigils refreshes a sigil the moment before/after a stamina flare happens.
		This is just a guide, a curiosity... for your enjoyment, and mine.
