Hidden in the lands in and around all of the cities are items which you can find and turn in for "REAL" items with the same name.  Participation is easy.  All you have to do is keep a sharp eye out searching everywhere you can.  Real items *will* be found.  Maybe the next one by you.

LOOK ON, UNDER AND BEHIND EVERYTHING.  There are great hiding spots everywhere!

We have also hidden some other REAL items within the game.  One such example would be special mugs that will earn you a REAL DragonRealms/GemStone mug.

You may only find a maximum of one item every six months per account.  When you find a "real" item, you will be given instructions on how to exchange it.  Follow these instructions precisely.  If you have any questions after you find an item, please do an ASSIST and a Gamemaster will help you with the proper information.

This script will check a target for real items.

You need to specify a target to check for real items.  Try ;rgem chair
=end

target = 0

if script.vars[1] == nil

	respond
	respond "Hey #{Char.name}, you need to specify a target to check for real items.  Try ;rgem chair"
	respond
	exit
end

if script.vars[1] =~ /(.*)/
	target = "#{script.vars[1]}"
end

fput "look on #{target}"
fput "look in #{target}"
sleep 1
fput "look under #{target}"
fput "look behind #{target}"
