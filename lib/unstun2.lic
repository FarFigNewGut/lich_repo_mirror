#This script will unstun anyone you see in the room with you, runs in the background
#checks if you're stunned/dead first, 
#Faiyth - Added the ability to ignore someone so you don't break a warn interact..
#I've added pauses to make sure it doesn't slow down the feed *too* much...
#you can increase these as you see fit, I think what I have in there is a pretty good balance
#let me know of any MAJOR issues, I'm not tailoring it specifcally for YOU, however
#Enjoy!
