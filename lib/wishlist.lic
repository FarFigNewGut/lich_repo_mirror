Title : Wishlist
Date : 10/17/2015
Author : Luxelle
Tags : festival, shopping, fest, shop, wish, list

Details :
 - Jot a quick list from your input line to note an item from a festival that you want to buy later
 - Puts the info into a wishlist in lich/logs/wishlist.log
 - Saves the date, the item name you provide, the room name, and the room id (tab delimited)

Use :
   ;wishlist NameOfItem (takes multiple words)

 Notes :
  - Because I always forget to go back to a festival for that ONE thing I thought I couldn't possibly forget...
  - Rename/delete the file when the fest is over to prevent it from being too big/confusing
