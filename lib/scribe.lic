=begin
	Script for writing letters.
	
	Usage: scribe <filename>
	
	filename should be the name of a text file in your data folder, which contains a letter you want to write in game.
	
	scribe assumes the object you have in your right hand is a piece of paper and writes the letter from the text file onto that piece of paper, converting newlines to vertical bars so that the letter is transcribed in a WYSIWYG fashion.
	
	scribe assumes you have a quill in your other hand or are in a room where a quill is not required to write.
	
	Please note that scribe does not check if the individual lines in the letter are too long for the game's input buffer. A line that overflows the input buffer will cause you to disconnect. You can avoid this by not writing lines that are that long!
