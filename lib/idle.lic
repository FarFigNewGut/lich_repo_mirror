=begin
Keeps you logged in by silently checking the number of items in your inventory, which the script grabs and throws away before you see it.

Use it especially while dead to stay logged in, or if you are AFK for whatever reason.

In principle you will never see this script do anything, but from time to time an "X items found" may slip through

Thanks to Xanlin for helping to debug and recode this script to work on all front ends!
