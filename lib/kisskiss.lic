        If you wear a face covering (like a veil or mask) and your rogue guild password
        uses KISS, you always have to remove the face covering to use your password.

        This script temporarily alters the map db to REMOVE and WEAR what you set
        as your face covering when entering the rogue guild via go2.

        Set your face covering with:
        ;var set rogue_guild_face_covering = <thing>
        example: ;var set rogue_guild_face_covering = veil

        The script will stay running, you can kill it to revert back to the normal movement
        in case something goes wrong.
