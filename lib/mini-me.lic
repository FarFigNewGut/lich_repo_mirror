	This makes your life a bit easier when setting up options for Mini Dreavenings!
	
	Just run the script and follow the instructions on the window to set your options. Your options will be saved with Dreaven so there is no need to set your options again unless you want to change them. You also don't need to run this script again after you set your options...again unless you want to change them.
