This script is designed for players seeking a cleric for Intercession.

It is quite spammy as it does not squelch!  The method is:
  1) PROFESSION CLERIC into an array
  2) PROFILE each cleric, waiting 1 second for each result
  3) Grab the ones who display their deity
  4) Output the results at the end

The method employed might not catch everything if you are lagged
