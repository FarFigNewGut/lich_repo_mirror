0.3 - Added ability to rebless multiple items losing bless in same swing.
			i.e. - multistrike jab, that throws a kick, should be able to bless
			all three possible items that could lose a bless in that(gloves, boots,
			brawling weapon)
0.2 - Fix for arrow bundles
0.1 - Initial write

Just wanna say thanks to the scripting channel on discord, you guys really helped me 
understand a bunch of this over the months I came back to GS.

Should use Symbol of Bless on any weapon bless of any kind that falls off. It will
also pause bigshot, sbounty, and/or treim to do so, then unpause them.

Please let me know of any cases where it seems to fail to bless your stuff. You can
find me in game quite often, and I'm on the Discord scripting channel a lot. Enjoy!
