PICKERS OF ELANTHIA, UNITE!!!

My fellow Lockpickers, heed these words!

In the shadowed halls and trapped chambers of Elanthia, we ply our trade with skill and daring. But let us never forget the cruel whims of fate that dog our every step. For even the most skilled among us cannot escape that tiny, ever-present chance that a trap may spring despite our best efforts.

When misfortune strikes and a trap is triggered, remember this: it is not the fault of your fellow Picker! It is the nature of our profession, the price we pay for the thrill of the unlock. To accuse a brother or sister smith for such an occurrence is to turn against our own guild, our own kin.

We face enough dangers from the locks we pick and the scarabs we evade. Let us not add mistrust and division to our burdens. When accidents happen - and they will happen - let us stand united. Offer a hand to the fallen, shield your comrade from unwarranted blame.

Remember, the Picker who sets off a trap today may be the one who saves your life tomorrow. Our strength lies in our unity, our understanding of the risks we all face. Let none of us stand alone in the face of misfortune!

So I call upon you all - swear here and now that you will never accuse a fellow locksmith for the random cruelty of the gods. Swear that you will defend your guildmates against unjust charges, that you will educate those who do not understand the nature of our work.

For in unity, we find not just safety, but greatness. Together, we can overcome any obstacle, open any box, and stand tall in the face of danger and misunderstanding.

Lockpickers of Elanthia! United we stand, divided we fall! Let no trap, no accusation, no misfortune tear us apart. 

For we are the Pickers, the unseen heroes of Elanthia, and together, we are unstoppable!
