  For Rangers. Maintains the Barkskin spell so long as there's mana. When you enter a Stunned state, immediately activates the Commune aspect of Barkskin if necessary (which requires 15+ ranks of Spiritual Lore, Blessings).

  The main body of this script was provided in Discord chat by Farfignewgut, thank you! I modified this by adding a mana check for the spell and the Commune Barkskin step.

  The maintenance aspect of the script works during combat. You could add an additional RoundTime check so Barkskin doesn't fire immediately, if that becomes necessary. Please note that my tests with Commune Barkskin have only been in non-combat situations so exercise due caution.
