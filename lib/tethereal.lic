As you reach for your runestaff tattoo, an ethereal haft protrudes from its center.  You grab the haft and pull an ethereal runestaff out.

As your ethereal runestaff flickers in and out of existence briefly, you sense it will expire soon.

A series of ethereal chains lashes out from your runestaff tattoo, as your ethereal runestaff seeps back into your tattoo.
