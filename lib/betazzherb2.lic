This is my FORK of the legendary betazzherb. The old version hasn't been updated in over 5 years and
I've been constantly updating mine to keep it working. If you're having issues with the old version,
give this one a try. - Tsalinx

locates and forages what you want and how many then returns you to the room you started.

syntax is ;betazzherb <herb name> <qty you want to find> <location (optional)>

;betazzherb setup for GUI setup.

example: ;betazzherb some pothinir grass 9 greymist woods (to find 9 pothinir in greymist woods only)
or ;betazzherb some acantha leaf 17 (just to find 17 acantha leaf anywhere close)

****Item name has to match, almost all herbs have 'some' in front, 'some acantha leaf'****

finds any forageable items including sticks and wiregrass

This script doesnt care if creatures are in the room, so be careful using it.
*******AGAIN, THIS SCRIPT HAS NO COMBAT CAPABILITIES, DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED!!!*******

v5 update: Mini-update to change a _drag command to put, hopefully bypassing some weirdness?

v4 update: Handle luminsecent indigo mushrooms properly, MARK them unsellable when found. 
           This has not been fully tested, because I haven't dug any up myself yet. 
           Let me know how it works for you.

author: Zzentar
location function added by Baswab/Gibreficul
GUI setup, additional features by Gnomad
Ongoing maintence by Gnomad
tags: foraging, herbs
