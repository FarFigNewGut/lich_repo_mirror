Disarm Watch
by Daedeus

Monitors for you getting disarmed.  If that happens, will remember what room you got disarmed in and remind you every 5 seconds.

Then you can go RECOVER ITEM when you are ready.

Has no_kill_all and recommended to ;autostart add disarmwatch, if you tend to get disarmed.

[bigshot]>prepare 1106
An uncontrollable urge to scratch the rash covering your body overcomes you, and you madly dig at it with your fingernails!

You drop your runestaff into the shadows!
[Use the RECOVER ITEM command while in the appropriate room to regain your item.]
