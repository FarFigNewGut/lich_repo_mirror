Herbheal Fork by Alastir (GS4Alastir@gmail.com)

Auto herb using/buying script.
Script will go the closest 'bench' and heal up with those herbs first before using anything in your herbsack.
It will then go and buy what it needs at the closest herbalist, use them to heal, and then store them in your herbsack for later use.

Thanks to Baerden and Tillmen for all the code I blatantly stole, and to Annelie who constantly is adding towns!
