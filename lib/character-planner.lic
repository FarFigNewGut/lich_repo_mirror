	Plan out your character with this nifty little script!
	
	Script can tell you what your stats will look like at a certain level as well as how many PTPs and MTPs you'll have at that level.
	
	You can also plan how you want to train your character. Enter how many skill ranks you want per level for each skill you want and the script will tell you how many skill ranks you would have at a particular level and will tell you if you'll have enough training points at that level.
	
	You can also plan out CMANs and ascension ranks. Script will tell you how many CMAN points/Ascention training points each skill will cost and also gives you information about what each skill does.
	
	Script also has a target practice combat simulator where you can simulate combat with critters based on the stats and skills you have set in the script.
	
	So download today and get to planning!
	
	More features are planned for the future. Check out the "Planned Features" tab in the script for more information.
