=begin
This will sail your ship in a determined pattern, 1. Line Pattern (North and then South continuously) or 2. Circle Pattern (North, West, South then East continuously) 
the script will notify you if any pirates appear and ask you your desired action.
This script is not intended to be used AFK in anyway.
To use just run the script from anywhere on your ship, underway or not. 
Enjoy
