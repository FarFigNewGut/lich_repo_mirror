This script will search the Delirium Manor, bundle bloodscrip, bundle vellum tickets and stow items.
You need to have invitational passes.

 Step 1:  Make sure your variables are configured.
 - ;vars set lootsack=container (The container where your goodies will be stored - backpack, cloak, etc)
 - ;vars set bookletsack=container (The container where your invitational passes are stored - backpack, cloak, etc)
 
 Step 2:  ;dm_runner
 Step 3:  profit


some golden parchment bloodscrip 	= 250
some smudged parchment bloodscrip 	= 30
some musty parchment bloodscrip 	= 25
some dusty parchment bloodscrip 	= 20
