    Hey wannabe RPer, can't remember the magical incantation
      for the verb you need in that special moment?  No sweat,
      wannabe.lic will save the day!

      ;wannabe <search terms>
      ;wannabe <search terms> <limit>

      will search a database of verbs by their commands and 3rd person
      messaging so that all those pesky verbs can be at YOUR fingertips, too!

    Note: The database was generated with a male half-elf as
    the 1st person actor, and a male giantman as the 2nd person actor.
    Both demeanors were set to neutral.

    Custom verbs

    If you have custom actions you'd like wannabe to search, you may create a
    file wannabe_custom.txt in your scripts/ directory.  The format should be
    one verb per line:

      VERB - Output

    Custom verbs will use the exact text in the file, and will not fill in your
    character's name as the builtin search results do.
