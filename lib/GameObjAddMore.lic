  GameObjAddMore IS DEPRECATED, due to its existance causing Bigshot to behave badly for new users of that script
  (and inadvertently cause denial-of-service attacks against the repository)

  Note the issue here is with Bigshot, NOT GameObjAddMore, but I am voluntarily removing GameObjAddMore from the repository.

  Please migrate to my newer script, 'xmlpatch', which replaces both GameObjAdd and GameObjAddMore as well as
  THIS SCRIPT IS DEPRECATED, and will be removed from the repository in a few weeks.

  This adds some specific items (and refines other items) to Lich's information that it uses to categorize different
  kinds of items.  This information is used by various scripts, including loot/sloot and various flavors,
  ;box and ;foreach

  These additions are in addition to those in GameObjAdd.lic -- you probably want that script as well.  However,
  this script is not dependant on that one.

  Add this to your autostart for all characters -- ;autostart add --global GameObjAddMore.
  Note that the script only needs a few moments to do its thing and will NOT remain running once it is completed.
