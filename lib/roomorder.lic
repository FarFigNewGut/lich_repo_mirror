	This script scans for a person in the room and reports their position
	Useful for merchanting events where they disable the room window
	and they're working by room order. 
	
	Works with partial names too.
	Also tells you how many people are in the room if it matches anything.
	
	examples:
	;roomorder drafix
	;roomorder draf
	;roomorder afi
