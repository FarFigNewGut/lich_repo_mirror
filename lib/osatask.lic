  Usage:
  
        Start the script from anyone on the ship. You will go to the Crow's Nest and get your task. 
		If the bird is not in the nest it will check if you are on a Man O' War then go to the second nest.
		If not on a Man O' War or if both nest's are in use, it will then return to the Captain's Quarters
		and wait for 20 seconds and return to try again until you turn in your current task and have a new one.
		If used in the Hag's Tavern it will use the board instead.
   Enjoy
