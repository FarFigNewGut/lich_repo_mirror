Runes Solution

The secret of the runes is very simple, the top set of runes is R S Z O in that order while the bottom one is E.
The E slides and based on its position, that is what you press for it to operate BUT there is a catch to all!
The step that slides out is ALWAYS the position where E is located. So if E is under a step already out ...
You have to press E and reset the steps to start over! So the puzzle has a flaw but still solvable!

     R S Z O
     <--E-->

So if it starts out at Z, you press Z and then it randomly will go to one of the other 3 spots (RS or O).
Depending on which one it goes to, you continue to press buttons but if it goes back to Z, you must press E and reset!
E always resets the puzzle to start over! That is the secret of the puzzle and the pattern to it!
