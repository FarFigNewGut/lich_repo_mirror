	def virgins
		fput "sing A dragon has come to our village today.;We've asked him to leave, but he won't go away.;Now he's talked to our king and they worked out a deal.;No homes will he burn and no crops will he steal."
		pause 7
		fput "sing Now there is but one catch, we dislike it a bunch.;Twice a year he invites him a virgin to lunch.;Well, we've no other choice, so the deal we'll respect.;But we can't help but wonder and pause to reflect."
		pause 7
		fput "sing Do virgins taste better than those who are not?;Are they salty, or sweeter, more juicy or what?;Do you savor them slowly? Gulp them down on the spot?;Do virgins taste better than those who are not?"
		pause 7
		fput "sing Now we'd like to be shed you, and many have tried.;But no one can get through your thick scaly hide.;We hope that some day, some brave knight will come by.;'Cause we can't wait around 'til you're too fat to fly."
		pause 7
		fput "sing Now you have such good taste in your women for sure,;They always are pretty, they always are pure.;But your notion of dining, it makes us all flinch,;For your favorite entree is barbecued wench."
		pause 7
		fput "sing Now we've found a solution, it works out so neat,;If you insist on nothing but virgins to eat.;No more will our number ever grow small,;We'll simply make sure there's no virgins at all!"
	end

	def knight
		fput "sing In days of old in a kingdom bold, there lived a fearsome dragon.;And the King he was in great distress and the countries spirits flagoned.;Until one day there came a knight, he was handsome, bold, and charming.;And he slew the dragon with his sword with a smile that was so disarming.;With a hey and a ho and a hey nany no, a smile that was so disarming."
		pause 13
		fput "sing Said the King I wish to know your name, but the knight said do not bother.;For the name of a knight of the realm says he, is the same as any other.;Said the King tonight in my daughter's bed you shall take your leisure.;And she'll reward you for your deed, with a night of exhausting pleasure.;With a hey and a ho and a hey nany no, anight of exhausting pleasure."
		pause 13
		fput "sing One daughter she had raven hair, a maiden young and chaste.;And she slept all night in the pale moonlight, naked to the waist.;The other daughter she was fair, the fairest in the town.;And she slept all night in the pale moonlight naked from her small waist down.;With a hey and a ho and a hey nany no, naked from her small waist down."
		pause 13
		fput "sing Well the knight he spends many hour behind the castle wall.;But the ending to my story dear, isn't what it seems at all.;For in neither bed of neither maid was he repaid for his glory.;But he slept all night with the King instead for this is a fairy story.;With a hey and a ho and a hey nany no, for this is a Fairy story."

	def miner
		fput "sing Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day.;Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day."
			pause 7
		fput "sing Lie doon, my dear, and in your ear,;To help you close your eye,;I'll sing a song, a slumber song,;A miner's lullaby."
			pause 7
		fput "sing Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day.;Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day."
			pause 7
		fput "sing Your daddy's doon the mine, my darling,;Doon in the Curbly Main,;Your daddy's howkin' coal, my darling,;For his ain wee wean."
			pause 7
		fput "sing Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day.;Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day."
			pause 7
		fput "sing There's darkness doon the mine my darling,;Darkness, dust and damp,;But we must have oor heat, oor light,;Oor fire and our lamp."
			pause 7
		fput "sing Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day.;Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day."
			pause 7
		fput "sing Your daddy coories doon, my darling,;Doon in a three foot seam,;So you can coorie doon my darling,;Coorie doon and dream."
			pause 7
		fput "sing Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day.;Coorie doon, Coorie doon, Coorie Doon, my darling,;Coorie doon the day."

	def mermaid
		fput "sing Twas Friday morn when we set sail;And we were not far from the land;When the captain, he spied a lovely mermaid;With a comb and a glass in her hand"
			pause 9
		fput "sing O the ocean's waves will roll;And the stormy winds will blow;While we poor sailors go skipping to the top;And the landlubbers lie down below (below, below);And the landlubbers lie down below"
			pause 9
		fput "sing And up spoke the captain of our gallant ship;And a well-spoken man was he;I have me a wife in Salem by the sea;And tonight she a widow will be"
			pause 9
		fput "sing O the ocean's waves will roll;And the stormy winds will blow;While we poor sailors go skipping to the top;And the landlubbers lie down below (below, below);And the landlubbers lie down below"
			pause 9
		fput "sing And up spoke the cookie of our gallant ship;And a red hot cookie was he;Saying I care much more for my pots and my pans;Than I do for the bottom of the sea"
			pause 9
		fput "sing O the ocean's waves will roll;And the stormy winds will blow;While we poor sailors go skipping to the top;And the landlubbers lie down below (below, below);And the landlubbers lie down below"
			pause 9
		fput "sing Then up spoke the cabinboy, of our gallant ship;And a nasty little lad was he.;I'm not quite sure I can spell 'mermaid';But I'm going to the bottom of the sea."
			pause 9
		fput "sing O the ocean's waves will roll;And the stormy winds will blow;While we poor sailors go skipping to the top;And the landlubbers lie down below (below, below);And the landlubbers lie down below"
			pause 9
		fput "sing Then three times around went our gallant ship;And three times around went she;Three times around went our gallant ship;And she sank to the bottom of the sea"
			pause 9
		fput "sing O the ocean's waves will roll;And the stormy winds will blow;While we poor sailors go skipping to the top;And the landlubbers lie down below (below, below);And the landlubbers lie down below"

	def special
		fput "sing There once was a lass named Daisily;who was couragous, loving, and pure;No woman's beauty could ever compare;As her beauty to men was a lure!"
		pause 7
		fput "sing Ger voice was very elegant;and her song was beyond compare;She was never allowed in a contest;Because to others it wouldn't be fair!"
		pause 7
		fput "sing Her song is one very dear;you should hold it close to your heart;If you have a chance to meet her;Pray from her you never have to part!"
		pause 7
		fput "sing Now this song was never about her;but merely about how she was beloved;As how her kindness was so vast;And her heart filled with endless love!"
