=begin
	Leave this script running in the background and whenever you prepare 925 the script will run a check on all positive/negative variables that are under your control (wounds, familiar in room with you, workshop, etc etc) and it will inform you of what you should correct before proceeding with your 925 cast to make sure you have the best possible chance to successfully enchant your item. If your mana is less than 25 when you prepare 925 the script will automatically release your spell and inform you that you don't have enough mana to cast 925. Not having 25 mana when you cast 925 can possibly blow up your item.
