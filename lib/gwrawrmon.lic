gwrawrmon.lic is a helper script for use with scripts written by Gwrawr
#TODO - use CharSettings for simple functions within


        ...  part 2/2 of
        506celerity.lic 

        Celerity script compatible with Bigshot
        Uses gwrawrmon script to track cooldowns on targets

        Under active development 1/3/2022

Keeps celerity up on self if given no arguments, else keeps it up on the target it is given

USAGE: 	none

Bigshot command examples: 

    script cel mybuddy(m6), cel myotherbuddy(m6), incant 502(m2), incant 901(m1 xx)
		tries to haste two different members, proceeds to attack
