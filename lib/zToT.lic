		zToT.lic
		Written by Ziled.
		Last Update 10/25/20
		Version 0.2
		
		Basic Tot Script. Runs through ToT one (1) time then exits.
		Does NOT check if you have keys, weapons, spells. This is your responsibility.
		Does NOT check if you have a FULL lootsack or if you are over encumbered.
		Uses gird, stow, and store all to equip and unequip weapon/shields as well as stow items
		Uses bigshot quick for attack sequence such that you will need to have it configured as if you were running bigshot quick manually.
		Uses Vars.lootsack for key storage and all loots
		MUST be run inside EG grounds from a mapped location.

		-0.2 Update regex for ghosts pulling into rooms.
		-0.1 Initial version
