	GUESS WHO!
	
	How is it that your character knows EVERYONE'S name in game, even if they have never interacted with the person before or saw anyone else use their name? Well this script aims to remedy that! (eventually!)
	
	With this script running whenever you LOOK in a room you will only see people referred to as "Unknown", until you decide you have sufficiently been introduced to them (or found out their name some other way), then you can do:
	
	;send guess add name
	
	For example: ;send guess add Dreaven
	
	To add them to the list of characters you know. From that point on that person's name will show up as normal in the room list.
	
	All "Unknown" people will have a number after their name, and this number will forever identify the same person. For example if the script notes Dreaven as "Unknown123", then Dreaven will forever be known as "Unknown123" until you add his name to the list.
	
	Eventually the script will use this unknown identifier in ALL instances of the person's name being shown (when LOOKing at them, when they use a verb, say something, etc) but for now it's just when LOOKing in a room.
	
	Commands:
	
	To add someone you know to your list of known characters: ;send guess add name"
	To remove someone from your list of known characters: ;send guess remove name"
	To reset your known list: ;send guess reset known"
	To reset your unknown list: ;send guess reset unknown"
	To see everyone on your known list: ;send guess list"
	
	Changelog:
	Version 1: Initial release!
	Version 2: Every person is now identified with a unique number identifier, this number will be used to interact with this person in game and with the script. This number stops being shown once you have added the person to your known list.
	Version 2: You can now scan a room to give each person a unique name based on their race and physical features. These names are saved forever, well until you change them or reset all names.
	Version 2: You can now change a person's temporary name to anything you want. Be sure to check out the help menu for how to use these new features.
