Pauses go2 and ego2 whenever a dead body is encountered. Run it in the
background. Might run past the body if you use typeahead.
Will pause even if the body is in the destination room.
If you know a general fix fix, please email me.
Does not stop if you are currently in a town center, as defined by ego2
Town centers are: 3668,188,228,1438,2300,1923,10861,1005,3519,2777,4653

Will add color to names if I figure that out.
