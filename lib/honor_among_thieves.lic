The player is not told what that symbol is.  2) At the end of the round, the player must declare to the Purloiner what their symbol is. If the player correctly identifies their own symbol, they move onto the next round. If not, they are eliminated.  3) For the first 5 minutes you're expected to remain in the playing area. During this time, you are encouraged to determine your symbol. Following this, you can venture out to discover answers to trivia questions."
  #@rulestwo = "4) A player cannot ask the Purloiner what their own symbol is. A player must use their wit to discover it on their own.  5) A player can ask the Purloiner what another player's symbol is, and the Purloiner is obligated to provide a truthful answer. The purloiner will whisper the answer to the asking player. Players will take turns asking the Purloiner about another player's symbol. You may only ask about 1 player at a time but can ask about multiple players in the same round.  6) Since player A does not know what symbol, they are, Player A can ask Player B to reveal to Player A what Player A's symbol is. Player B is under no obligation to give an honest answer to Player A."
  #@rulesthree = "7) Each round, players are presented with a trivia question. Players who correctly answer the questions add bonus silver to their personal prize pot. Those who answer incorrectly have silver removed from their personal prize pot.  8) If you fail to answer the question correctly by the end of a round, the 'Kraken' is in play for the next round. While the Kraken is active, the Purloiner is not obligated to correctly identify a player's symbol when asked.  9) For each round that a player is not eliminated the community prize does not increase. Subsequently, each time a player is eliminated the community prize pot increases.  10) A standard round time is 10 minutes. However, this may randomly change throughout the game.  11) Players remaining at the end of round 6 are the winners and split the community prize pot and win their personal prize pot."
  @rules = "1) I assign you a symbol but don't tell you.  2) Machtig tells you the trivia question for that round. Announces out loud to everyone.  3) I announce the 10 minute timer starts.  4) You take a few minutes to figure out your symbol, and you ask about other players symbols so you can either help them or stab them in the back.  5) You go discover trivia answer.  6) After 10 minutes you come back to the play area.  7) I'll ask you to state your symbol. If you get it right, you move on and;"
  @rulestwo = "8) I'll ask you to whisper the answer to the trivia question to Machtig. If you get trivia question right more money in your prize pot.  9) If you get the trivia questions wrong, then the next round the Kraken is active and the Purloiner does not have to give an honest answer about your symbol to anyone who asks.  10) If you guess your symbol wrong, you are eliminated.  11) After everyone attempts to guess their symbol, the next round starts.  12) If someone is eliminated, then the community prize pot goes up. If no one is eliminated the pot does not grow in value."
