Author: Soliere
Give stuff to someone and continue giving until you are out of the item.
You have to change this script each time you want to give a different item. I keep it open handy in notepad to modify on the fly. Then I save the changes to the script, then stop and restart the script in Stormfront.
I use this script a lot with one I made called acceptstow.lic.
WARNING: Be careful. I'm not sure how you could potentially lose items with this script but it is so primitive that there is the possibility for item loss so PAY ATTENTION to what you're doing and ALWAYS at the end, do a "LOOK" to see if anything got dropped on the ground etc.
WARNING: This script may violate Simutronics/GemstoneIV game policies I don't think so but I do not know. Use at your own risk.
