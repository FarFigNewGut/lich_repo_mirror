Manage your inventory with phasing containers (sorcerer not included).  Make weightless, lock, unlock ... yeah, that stuff.  With one command!

Until a future version with a GUI, you need to open the script and edit a couple variables at the top.
  (This is reasonably well-commented.)

    tags: sorcerer 
    version: 2.0

USAGE: 
  ;phase rephase
    This will 'rephase' all known phase targets in your phasing container.
    
    It does this by pulling them out, dropping them IFF they are shifting, and rephase them.
    
  ;phase <container>
    This will toggle a single phase cycle on the specified container.
    
    The first phase cycle is checking in your phasing container for the specified container.  If it's in there, get it out, wear it, unlock it, and open it.

    Otherwise assume the target container is worn, so it should be closed, locked, phased, and put away.

# Edit this stuff

# Whatever you want to phase
phaseTargets = [ "satchel", "kit", "purse", "jacket", "belt"]

# The container that's going to hold all the phased gear
phaseContainer = "cloak"

# The container to keep your key in
keyContainer = "case"

# Regular user shouldn't need to do anything after this
# If you have some fancy phasing gear that somehow doesn't use a key, there are already a few examples to peek at.
