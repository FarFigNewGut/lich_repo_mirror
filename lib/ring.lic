=begin
	A script for switching to the right position for your multi-setting teleport rings

	The script itself is pretty self-explanatory when you read it.
	It assumes the first time you run it that you're on position 1.
	It will remember which position you set it to afterwards.

	It will figure out the shortest way to get to the position you want.

	Variables that might be of interest to you:
	number_of_settings
	
	P.S. change the word ring to whatever (amulet/bracer/thingamabob) you need

	Usage:
	;ring 4 [teleport to setting #4]
	;ring reset [records what is the current position]

	right = (target_position - current_position) % number_of_settings
	left <= right ? left.times{fput 'pull my ring'} : right.times{fput 'push my ring'}
end
