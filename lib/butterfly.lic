    The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
    I can feel too much is never enough

    I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
    To show me life is precious then I guess it's true
    But to tell the truth I really never knew til I met you
    See I was lost and confused twisted and used up
    Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
    My lifestyle's wild I was livin' like a wild child
    Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
    So yo what's happenin' now?
    I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
    And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd so

    Whatever tickles your fancy
    Girl it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
    So sexy almost evil
    Talkin' bout butterflies in my head
    I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
    But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
    You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
    And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
    So butterfly here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
    And a thank you miss
