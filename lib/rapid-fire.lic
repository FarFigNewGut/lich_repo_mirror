=begin
	
	A spammy Rapid Fire script that will be guaranteed to keep haste up for yourself and anyone else around you
	
	Usage: ;rapid person1 person2 person3 ...
	or for self-Rapid Fire only: ;rapid
	
	Adopted by Arrot from Drafix's Haste.lic
	
	changelog:
	-updated it to not haste everyone, now you have to specify who to haste
	-fixed a bug with hasting yourself when someone elses haste drops
	-added partial name matching [ex: ;haste draf]
	-added armor hindrance retries (Thank Dionket)
	-bugfix castrt on hasting others
	-bugfix forgot to add case insensitivity to cast rt failures
	-Someone didn't like it spamming while stunned so I added a wait.
