Title : xfer
Date : 08/01/2016
Author : Luxelle
Game: GemStone
Tags : inventory, swap, containers, change, storage, transfer, avalon
Version : 1.1

Details :
 - Takes items listed with your command line and puts them in a new container
 - Set source and destination containers quickly with ;vars setup

Use :
   ;vars setup - then add 
     sourcesack <FROM container name>
     destinationsack - <TO container name>
     Exit/Save

   ;xfer item1 item2 item3 item4 ...
 
 - Use quotation marks for an item that takes two words, ordinals will FAIL because the
   game re-orders things. Don't use ordinals.
   ;xfer "raw pack" "dragon ruby" "shimm sapphire"

 Notes :
  - Avalon compatible (Because not everything is and NOW it matters!)
  - Quick and dirty little transfer utility to save ALL THAT TYPING.
  - <3 your wrists, use a script when you can.

Changelog :
  - v 1.1 2 August 2016
  - Added version field in header block
  - clarified vars names in header block for instructions
  - added timeout/continue if it can't find an item.
