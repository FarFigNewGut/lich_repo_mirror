=begin
Script that loads a definition which runs scripts from within other scripts
Because sometimes a script needs another script to run
usage is... runme(array)   or runme(array, false)
array should be an array where the first value is the name of the script, and the following values are your command line variables.
(Example.)   bigshit = ['bigshot', 'head']      runme(bigshit)   or runme(bigshit, false) 
the first example will run bigshot and wait for it to terminate to continue within that script.   
the second example will run bigshot and continue to run without waiting for bigshot to terminate.
