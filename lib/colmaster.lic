	Master COL in Solhaven!
	
	This script will ask if you want to join COL if you are not already a member of a society. If you wish to join COL then the script will join COL for you.
	
	If you are already a member of the Guardians of Sunfist or the Order of Voln and wish to join COL you have to first leave your current society then run this script.
	
	Script will seek out the Matron in Solhaven, join COL, and get busy mastering COL for you. All automagically!
	
	Script will not gather skins or flowing white robes but will turn them in automatically if you have them in an open container. Script will also tell you which critters you need to skin to fulfill your skinning task and which lich rooms they can be found in.	
	
	Script will handle every other task all on its own! Amazing!
	
	NOTE: While all answers to the Inquisitor's questions appear to be in the script, in some cases the script doesn't have the exact wording of the question right so it might hang up sometimes in the Inquisitor's room. If this happens you can try to find the correct answer within this script by searching for keywords of the question. Also please send the exact question to Tgo01 on the PC forums or message them to Dreaven in game so I can correct the problem in the script.
