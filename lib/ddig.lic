# Version 3.6.7 Taleph.
# This version uses your lootsack variable. You set it before you run this program, and you only need to do it once: ;vars set lootsack=longcoat (for example).
# If the container is a T5 or Jackpot, I EXIT the script.  
# 
# 
# I don't buy your picks for you...that's so easy...and you have to pawn every 6 picks or so anyway.
#
# NEW ADDITION: There have been a high number of policy 18 violations (running scripts unattended). That's a bad thing for everyone.
#      To help with this, I've put in a timer that will ask you for input every ~7 minutes or so to let the script know you're
#      paying attention. This is to help you-and to pause the script if your attention wanders. If a script check is initiated
#      before the script auto-pauses you will NOT escape penalties for unattended scripting. This does, however, help if you
#      get distracted and forget to pause the game by stopping the continual running.
#
#      You can opt OUT of this by starting EGDig with "off" in the command line: "EGDig off".
#
#      Also note, though the script pauses or exits on a T5 or a Jackpot, that does NOT protect you from a script check...
#      and that's not the intent of the pause. The pause is so you can admire your prize! That's all.
#
#
#      HINT: You might want to highlight the string:

#--------------------- Master, it's been a few minutes...are you still wake?" ----------------------
