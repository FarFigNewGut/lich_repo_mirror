##rforge.lic. An attempt at editing a script by Rikkit...most if not all thanks should be given to Dan and his ;dforge script. Be wearing an apron. Have coins in the bank. The script will withdraw 8100 silvers each trip to the bank (7500 to buy 1 mithril blocks and 600 to cover workshop fees). Have a container as your STOW default that has plenty of room. The script will attempt to craft perfect forging hammer heads. Make sure that item 9 at your local forging supply shop is a mithril block, otherwise change the instances here that order mithril blockS to the appropriate number. Make sure that the wastebasket in your forging workshop is a BIN, otherwise change those instances here. Enjoy.
