=begin
	
	A spammy haste script that will be guaranteed to keep haste up for yourself and anyone else around you
    
    Modified by SpiffyJr to skip people that start berserking.
	
	Usage: ;haste person1 person2 person3 ...
	or for self-haste only: ;haste
	
	By Drafix
	
	changelog:
	-updated it to not haste everyone, now you have to specify who to haste
	-fixed a bug with hasting yourself when someone elses haste drops
	-added partial name matching [ex: ;haste draf]
	-added armor hindrance retries (Thank Dionket)
	-bugfix castrt on hasting others
	-bugfix forgot to add case insensitivity to cast rt failures
	-Someone didn't like it spamming while stunned so I added a wait.
