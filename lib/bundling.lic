# Version 1.1 Taleph. Note that I slow the script down if others are in the room so you don't spam them.
# Also, I don't handle a full bundle because I dump everything on a mule after each pick run.
# If it's a real problem for you, let me know and I'll add a trap for it...but most likely I'll just stop the script
# so you can move the full bundle by hand...
