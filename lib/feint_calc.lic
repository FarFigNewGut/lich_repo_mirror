  Feint Calculator, by Gnomad

  This script tells you how successful your feint was:
  *  Tells you how much RT you inflicted.
  *  Tells you how by how much you changed a target's stance.

  I worked out the stance percentage mechanics, and it only took 3 feints.
  They were that obvious: endroll - 100, max 100.

  Note that -43% stance means that the stance changed by 43 percentage points,
  not that the stance is decreased by 43%. Just subtract, don't multiply.

  Feint timer is now feint calculator. Enjoy!
