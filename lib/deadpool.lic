#<highlight fg='0000ff'>^You carefully push a small ball of cotton into the lock mechanism, surrounding and protecting the small vial from anything that may shatter it\.$|^Knowing how delicate magical glyphs can be, you scrape some extra lines into the markings hoping to alter their meaning and defeat the spell they may hold\.$|^Using a bit of putty from your (slender leather toolkit|brown leather case), you manage to block the tiny hole in the lock plate\.$|^Using a bit of putty from your brown leather case, you cake a thin layer on the lock casing, hopefully sufficient to prevent sparks when the metal arm strikes it\.$|^Taking a lump of putty from your (slender leather toolkit|brown leather case), you carefully apply it to the end of the small tube\.  That should block whatever it's meant to deploy\.$|^Using the metal grips from your (slender leather toolkit|brown leather case), you manage to reach in and grasp the post of the metal hammer, and bend the weak metal out of striking range of the vial\.|With a little force applied to the springs, you manage to pop them inside the (box|chest|coffer|strongbox|trunk), from within which comes the tinkle of breaking glass, followed by a strong acrid smell\.$|^You carefully nudge the scarab free of its prison without disturbing the lock too much\.  The scarab falls from the lock and onto the ground in front of you\.$|^\*scritch scritch\*  If that had been any easier, you could have done it blindfolded\.$|Another moment of prodding, and you are able to poke the gem free of its metal housing, whereupon it falls down into the lock mechanism and out of sight\.|^Using the pair of metal grips, you manage to pull out the two pins that hold the upper and lower jaw pieces together\.  As the pins are removed, the jaws suddenly close and warp under the tremendous strain applied by their arming mechanism\.$|^With a little ingenuity you manage to grind down parts of the lock mechanism with your metal file, so it won't come in contact with the crystal when you try to open it\.$|^You gently slide your (dagger|knife|spike) into the space under the lid and slice through the cord.  That oughta do it.$|^With great care you take a pair of metal grips and bend the sensitive metal rods out of alignment.  It looks as though they cannot be pressed together by the lock mechanism any more.$|As the air hits the gel, it begins to harden and turn to dust, blowing away in the wind as if it never existed\.$</highlight>
