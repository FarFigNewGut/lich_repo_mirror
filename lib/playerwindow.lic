  This script creates a dedicated window to display other players in the room
  and their statuses in real time.
  Features:
  - Continuously updates with current players in the room.
  - Displays statuses (if available) in a standardized format.
  - Automatically removes players that leave.
  - Uses consistent window formatting.
  - Allows you to click on another player that is sleeping to POKE them awake.
  - Allows you to click on another player that is prone to PULL them up.
  - (Spell 108 Known) Allows you to click on another player that is stunned to cast 108 and UNSTUN them.
  - Allows you to click on another player that is stunned and wave any oak wand in your inventory at them to UNSTUN THEM.
  - (Spell 209 Known) Allows you to click on a player that is webbed to cast 209 and UNTRAMMEL them.
  - If you are an empath, allows you to click on another player that is injured and attempt to heal them using the lich script ;ecure.
  - Will only display player names (nouns) and will display them alphabetically.

  Changelog:
   1.2.0 (2025-05-31)
        Added Spam Filter On|Off to allow you to filter out all other players' spell casting, herb munching, empath healing, and urchin movement.
