This script is designed to run alongside bigshot.
This script will detect when you are rescuing a child,
while running bigshot.

Once the child appears, it will run ;child2, and deliver
the child to the guard.  Then it will return to where
you found the child and resume hunting.

This is friendly with bigshot lead / bigshot tail.
