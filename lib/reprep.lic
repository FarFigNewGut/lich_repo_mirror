	this seems to me to be a useful script that does not yet exist:

	repeat.lic
	usage: ;repeat (string1),(string2), .... ,(stringn), (number)

	function:
	the script will input each (string x) in order, (number) amount of times.

	example 1:
	;repeat get my uncut diamond from my satchel, sell my uncut diamond, 10
	(this would get 10 diamonds from my satchel and sell them)

	example 2:
	;repeat order 7, buy, order 7, buy, bundle, put my arrows in my quiver, 6
	(this would order a bundle of arrows (shop item #7), then another, then bundle them together, and put that bundle in my quiver - and repeat this entire process 6 times)


	I'm too stupid to figure out how to split the regex input by reading the commas.
	so, help, please?

	repeat was taken so this is reprep. Enjoy.
