#This script will constantly run in the background and will give you a story-line text prompt either when your bounty cooldown timer runs out (which means you can get a new bounty now) or when your time goes from zero to more than zero (i.e., you just got a new bounty).
#As a practical pointer, I often use this script together with ;checksaturated.lic to know when to turn in bounties and when to get new bounties. I add both of these scripts to my ;autostart, and I add the following phrase to my custom highlights: "You can get a new bounty now." You can even add a sound notification coupled with this custom string highlight to further notify yourself.
#This script shouldn't need any setting up to work.
