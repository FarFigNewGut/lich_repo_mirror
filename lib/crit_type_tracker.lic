	VISUAL Crit tracking, for melee, archer, bolting, and CS attacks...  BETA.
	UPDATE:  5-28-2013 	V-02.01
	By Gibreficul, reformatted by Tillmen because he's awesome.
		Information pulled from Krakii's critical tables.
		Used script 702.lic from the repo to add HIDDEN DAMAGE from 702 to the output
	Recent update:		 *	UAC-  Jab, Punch, Grapple, Kick
					*	Updated for ranged, may fuck with thrown/shield users.
					*	Sorcerer additions.  (Still under review)
	Notes:  	I have pulled some information from my own observations.
			unknown damages were likely pulled from 719 crits or weapon flares.
			If any of these unknowns is seen by you, I'll add what I can when I can.
