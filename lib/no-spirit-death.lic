	This script won't let you use signs if using said sign will result in a spirit death. For example if you attempt to use Sign of Healing (which instantly costs 2 spirit) and you don't have at least 3 spirit then the script won't let your Sign of Healing command go through and you'll LIVE!
	
	Script also checks which signs you have active that drain spirit after their duration ends (Sign of Swords, Sign of Shields, Sign of Dissipation, Sign of Madness.) 
	
	So let's say you have Sign of Swords active (costs 1 spirit after duration ends), and you try to use Sign of Wracking (costs 5 spirit instantly), this means the spirit cost after Sign of Swords falls off is 6, if you don't have at least 7 spirit when you try to use Sign of Wracking then the script won't allow you to use Sign of Wracking.
	
	If you want to use a sign anyways then first kill this script by doing ;kill no-spirit-death
	
	DISCLAIMER! I take no responsibility for spirit deaths while using this script. I have tested this script as much as I can and I see no reason for your character to suffer a spirit death while using this script, but I make no guarantees this script is 100% effective.
	
	This script is meant to be a fail safe.
