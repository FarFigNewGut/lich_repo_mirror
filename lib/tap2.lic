Someone asked for this on LNET the other night so here it is.

To run: ;tap2

Runs in the background. If you go hunting you'll probably want to disable it. Up to you.

Make sure you set up waggle for whatever spells you want to share.
	
Start this script to:
	1. Automatically armor support someone when they tap you.
	2. Automatically blur people when someone touches you. Will grab the person that initiated it.
	3. Automatically guard people when someone pulls you. Will grab the person that initiated it.

For added benefit, will accept manna bread and eat it with a thank you message to the person donating.

Rejects tips.

Thanks people for sending mana.

To do:
	1. Better error handling.
