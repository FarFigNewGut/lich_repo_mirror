This script will try to cast Minor Sanctuary (213) and keep it up for you. It will exit if you move rooms or if the room is not sanct-able (already sancted or demon present).

I recommend making an alias to use this script by simply typing 213
;alias add --global 213 = ;213
or
;alias add 213 = ;213
