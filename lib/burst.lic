This script keeps up the CMAN Burst of Swiftness
  This CMAN is only for monks.
  https://gswiki.play.net/Burst_of_Swiftness

Function of script:
 * It will continue running until you ;kill burst
 * It will start BURST as soon as you have the stamina.
 * It will start trying to BURST again after cooldown.
 * If your muscles are popped, it will wait.
