You close your eyes and reach out with your mind, searching for your spiritual presence throughout the land...
Through your spiritual connection you sense Heimdo...    
He has a medium neck injury, a minor right leg injury, a minor left leg injury, a medium chest injury, a minor abdomen injury, and a minor back injury.  
The imprint will hold through 1139 more transfers and last about 3 more minutes.
