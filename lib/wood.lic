Thus, any quantities of sephwir remaining in use today can be assumed to have been harvested before the Yuriqen forests were closed. This results in the wood being both rare and almost priceless. There are unverified reports of individual trees growing in the Turamzzyrian region of Helt, however no living trees are commonly known. Attempts to propagate the trees in other areas have met with no success, and it is thought that this is due to a critical connection between the magic known to have been resident in the soil of Yuriqen and the sephwir trees living there. Sephwir makes a superior wood for bows, and weapons crafted of the beautiful, silver-hued wood figure prominently in fables surrounding the archer armies of the Yuriqen Sylvans.");

Shiny dark leaves that are almost black are under-faced with a silvery grey hue. The leafstalks are sender with 1-2 glands. Witchwood bark is as dark as its foliage, grey or brown, and rough with irregular ridges. A cousin of the mistwood tree, it is often said that the likeness of gnarled faces can sometimes be seen in the bark pattern of the witchwood. The flowers are greyish green, on long stalks back of new leaves in early spring; multiple 1/4 inch male flowers erupt in long gin heads 5/8 inch wide; solitary female flowers are usually found on separate trees and are lavender in color. The fruit is long, and oblong in shape and of a dark purple color, very sour to taste. The fruit is poisonous unless it is processed, and is said to have medicinal purposes depending on the preparation. The wood is not usually used in construction, as it is too soft. However, it is often used for heating purposes and is prized for use in the making of wands and flutes.");

According to stories told by the men and elves of the mysterious Wyrdeep Forest, these rare, solitary trees are said to entangle and hang woodsmen and hunters with grisly results. Thought to be a cousin of the willow, the wyrwood is a large tree with 1 or more straight and usually leaning trunks, upright branches, and narrow or irregular crown. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often slightly curved to one side, and they grow densely upon the trees boughs. While these trees have been known to grow within the forest, they are most commonly found not too far distant from streams. They are known to have an exceptionally deep taproot, which probably accounts for their ability to live a distance from a water source, having tapped instead into underground springs. It is also thought that the taproot is the source for their superior magical qualities. Wyrwood is usually only used to produce bows; any contact of the wood with metal soon produces corrosion of the ore, with the result that the studs and banding common with shields and staves is unsatisfactory.");
