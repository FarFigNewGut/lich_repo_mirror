=begin
	Script for making speeches.
	
	Usage: speechify <filename> <optional flag>
	
	filename should be the name of a text file in your data folder, which contains a list of commands to execute while delivering the speech.
	optional flag can be -s to indicate that the entire speech should be spoken, or omitted otherwise.
	
	Each time you send "next" to speechify using ;send, it will send the next line of your speech to the game. I recommend creating an alias or macro for ";send to speechify next" that you can use to advance the speech. speechify ignores all game output that is not specifically sent to it with ;send.
	
	If you follow the filename with "-s", speechify will instead SAY each line of your speech.
