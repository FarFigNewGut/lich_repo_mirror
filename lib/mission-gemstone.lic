It awaits within the chest in the Shrine of Offerings, which is in the village of Eldurhaart.|^After helping to slay one of the great cold wyrms of the Hinterwilds, you noticed a group of gigas from Eldurhaart watching you.

You should find someone who can help you investigate its origins!|^You've found Ilyra, whose friend and fellow researcher Caiathas discovered a crumbling gemstone charm in the Hinterwilds.  Now it falls to you to provide her with Caiathas's last note to her.|^You've shared the proof of Caiathas's demise with the researcher Ilyra, but this is no time to grieve.

		/^Ilyra has an idea of how to restore the crumbling gemstone you retrieved from the Hinterwilds.  She has shared knowledge of a dwarf named Beylin Bittersteel, a master lapidary and bard whose powers might restore the gemstone's integrity.  His last known whereabouts were somewhere in Zul Logoth.|^You've encountered a human bard, Reston Talvert Ineuros Veswind the Sixth, in the town of Zul Logoth.

You need the dwarven lapidary's help to restore the crystalline structure of your gemstone.|You have found Beylin Bittersteel at the Golden Helm on Teras Isle.  Now you can recruit him to help with the purification of your charm.  If you need to find him again, you can probably ask the inn's hound to retrieve him for you.|Beylin Bittersteel wants you to give him 250,000 silvers.  He has promised to purify your gemstone charm once the payment is made.  You can pay him with a promissory note or cold, hard coin./ => {

		#Step 8 Part 1
		/^Ilyra believes that the gigas nearly destroyed the gemstone by trying to empower it using the might of an ancient being entombed beneath Angargreft.  If you are to be successful in empowering the charm, she believes you'll need a special setting made from kroderine.  Ilyra has asked that you travel to the ruined city of Moonsedge and scour the ruins to see if you can find any kroderine smelted by their once-renowned metallurgists.|^Upon arriving in Moonsedge, you encountered a phantasmal whitesmith.  He seems like a real delight.  You should ask him about a setting for your gemstone./ => {

		/^The phantasmal whitesmith, Jires, has agreed to craft a setting of kroderine for your gemstone charm.  He only has one condition: the kroderine must come from a stickpin worn by one of Barlan Kane's nobles in Moonsedge.  You'll need to kill patrician vampires in Moonsedge Castle until you find the stickpin on one of them./ => {
			"Name" => "Kill patrician vampires in Moonsedge Castle",

			"Description 2" => "have to kill vampires until you get a message about wasting your time.",
		},
		
		#Step 8 Part 3
		/^You're starting to think that Jires must have been mistaken about the kroderine stickpin belonging to one of the vampires.  You should go back and talk to him.  He may have misremembered, on account of being dead.|Light the furnace in Jires's backroom so that he can walk you through the process of casting a kroderine setting for your gemstone.|If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.  You need to light the furnace in Jires's backroom so that he can walk you through the process of casting a kroderine setting for your gemstone charm./ => {

		#Step 9
		/^Well, that was different.  Growing impatient with your fumbling, Jires briefly possessed your body.  It was uncomfortable, but using your form, he successfuly placed your gemstone in its kroderine setting.  It's time to return to Ilyra in Sylvarraend to ask her how to empower your gemstone.  The end of the road is near./ => {
