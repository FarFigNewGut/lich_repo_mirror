		/^Ilyra has an idea of how to restore the crumbling Gemstone you retrieved from the Hinterwilds.  She has shared knowledge of a dwarf named Beylin Bittersteel, a master lapidary and bard whose powers might restore the Gemstone's integrity.  His last known whereabouts were somewhere in Zul Logoth./ => {

		/^Ilyra believes that the gigas nearly destroyed the Gemstone by trying to empower it using the might of an ancient being entombed beneath Angargreft.  If you are to be successful in empowering the Gemstone, she believes you'll need a special setting made from kroderine.  Ilyra has asked that you travel to the ruined city of Moonsedge and scour the ruins to see if you can find any kroderine smelted by their once-renowned metallurgists./ => {

He only has one condition: the kroderine must come from a stickpin worn by one of Barlan Kane's nobles in Moonsedge.  You'll need to kill patrician vampires in Moonsedge Castle until you find the stickpin on one of them./ => {

		},
		
		#Step 12
		/^Well, that was different.  Growing impatient with your fumbling, Jires briefly possessed your body.  It was uncomfortable, but using your form, he successfuly placed your Gemstone in its kroderine setting.  It's time to return to Ilyra in Sylvarraend to ask her how to empower your Gemstone.  The end of the road is near./ => {
