 Title : Amunet
 Date : 02/05/2012
 Author : Oweodry

 Use :
  ;amunet

 Details :
  Amunet always-on script. It has the following features:
  - Uses society symbols if available
  - Retrieves & wears a fresh crystal amulet if appropriate
  - Will pause renewal (until thought net is back up) if amulets have run out

 Notes :
  - Designed to be added to favorites list: ;favs add [global] amunet
  - Doesn't work with amulet holders (cyber-barbies: fix it or get over it)
  - If you rely upon crystal amulets, ;settings add imbedsack <container>
  - No support or future updates are guranteed
  - My scripts: http://forum.gsplayers.com/showthread.php?73663

 Updates :
  - 05/21/2010 Released
  - 05/22/2010 Wasn't checking all containers if preference failed (fixed)
  - 12/14/2011 This script was janky as shit, did a near 100% re-write
  - 02/05/2012 Added functionality to wait until leaving antimagic rooms
  - 08/26/2012 Added wait until out of rooms where swimming (antimagic-like)

 Thanks :
  - Auryana for giving me some inventory searching code examples (05/2011)
