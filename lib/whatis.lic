A small number of flares aid the wielder, such as Bubble flares, and some flares deal a stun and/or knockdown. Some flares, such as Acuity, can be further enhanced by special Merchants. A flare's effectiveness can vary depending on the target. For example, trolls receive double the damage from fire flares.
