=begin
	This script calculates the exact weight of 
	the stuff you are carrying.
	
	DISCLAIMER: Only works when you
	1. Are unencumbered
	2. Are not wearing armor 
	3. Do not have Strength on
	4. Your STR and CON stats are not enhanced 
	   in any way.
	
	You MUST also have enough silver in your bank
	account to encumber yourself when you have
	zero items in your inventory.
	
	Can be used to calculate exact 
	weights of items as follows:
		1. Run the script while the item is NOT in
		   your inventory. Remember the number it
		   gives you.
		2. Get the item, run the script again, and
		   subtract the two numbers.
