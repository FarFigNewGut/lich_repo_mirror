	* foxfox will auto determine whether to observe (perception) or track (survival).

	* To set the Fox Hunting Mode timeout (in seconds) use -> ;e echo UserVars.foxfox = NUMBER

	* If you want the most raikhen, as fast as possible, use farm mode (;foxfox).
	
	* If you don't mind taking longer, and trying to find the fox, use hunting mode (;foxfox fox).
	
	* If you want to use your own tactics, or to explore, use manual mode (;foxfox manual).

	* Current fox hunting movement logic is based on fox.lic which is passable, but flawed.
	  This will eventually be replaced with a better process.  Stay tuned!
