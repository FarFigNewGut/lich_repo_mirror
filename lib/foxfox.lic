    * If you want the most raikhen, as fast as possible, use farm mode (;foxfox).
	
    * If you don't mind taking longer, and trying to find the fox, use hunting mode (;foxfox fox).
	
    * If you want to use your own tactics, or to explore, use manual mode (;foxfox manual).

    * Current fox hunting movement logic is based on fox.lic which is passable, but flawed.
      This will eventually be replaced with a better process.  Stay tuned!

# multi threading (no sign rooms in fox hunt and manual mode, standing in cave entrance/exit in manual mode)

# average raikhen tracker (make a variable that the user can reset)
