|-2021 Jdeed Script - Please do not AFK Script in Prime.-|

Jdeed is a script that will take you to Landing bank and withdraw a 50k note.  (Encumbrance reasons)

Half-Krolvins will withdraw 75k note.  (Sorry!) 

It will take you to the caravansary, buy 10 rubies and get deeds at the Landing temple.

Level 100 characters will see sharp diminishing returns past 40 deeds.

Original concept of script derived from 10deeds.
