##Danforge.lic, by Dan.  Be wearing an apron.  Have coins in the bank.  Have a container as your STOW default that has enough room for blocks.  This will rank you up in crafting.  Make sure that item 3 at your local forging supply shop is the BLOCK, otherwise change the instances here that order blocks to the appropriate number.  Make sure that the wastebasket in your forging workshop is a BIN, otherwise change those instances here.  Enjoy.
