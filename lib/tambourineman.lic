=begin
Modified script taken from ;music written by Xuilebkaas that supports the limited play styles for tambourines. Not sure about cymbals, but I'm assuming they have limited styles as well.

Designed to play your instrument in a random style every 6 minutes
Need to have instrument in hand
Usage ;music (instrument)
Currently supports Cymbals? and tambourine.
Play safe

ALL CREDIT FOR THIS SCRIPT GOES TO XUILEBKAAS, I just modified a few lines.
