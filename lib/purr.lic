# purr.lic
# Made by Luniere on Aug 20, 2018 for Polveiss. Original script was his.
# This was an attempt to convert the following to a lich script:
# Match filter1 luniere glances at you and makes a little purring noise.
# Filter1: put send 100 luniere; pause 3; goto start.
# Lookout! It could blow!
