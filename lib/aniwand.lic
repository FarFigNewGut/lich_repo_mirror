# Uses your animate wand to give your animate a weapon. Helpful in busy situations (like OSA) when you're trying to make the thing drop its weapon. # Right now you have to type in the weapon its holding but next version it will drop it automatically. I am new at this and still learning. :)

# Dont forget to ;vars set animatewand=your wand
