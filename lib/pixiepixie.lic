    This script has been replaced by foxpixiehunt.lic.  I strongly recommend using it instead of pixiepixie.

    There is an error with pixiepixie that will cause it to throw away sacks with loot, if your container is full.

    The new script also properly handles getting back to the entrance, instead of running you all over first.
