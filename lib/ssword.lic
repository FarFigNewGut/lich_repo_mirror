    Singing Sword Utility
    Many thanks to Tgo01 who was instrumental in writing this script as I know nothing about Ruby
    This script will cease attacking if entering a room all ready occupied.
    If you Sonic weapon this script will recall it to your location.

    SYNTAX - ;ssword <VAR1> <VAR2> <VAR3>
        VAR1 - name of the item you wish to create.
        VAR2 - name of a primary creature that you may be hunting
        VAR3 - name of a secondary creature you may encounter in your hunt

        Use ;k ssword
        to exit properly

    Caution this script when activated will emulate the commands you may use manually while you hunt.
    Remember the rules no AFK while using this script.

    changelog:
        v1.1 (2021-01-21)
            This script will stand you up if knocked down.
            Added section to end script if you die.
            Will ensure correct number of variables.
            still has two gliches I haven't been able to correct.  
            Both the same problem, won't engage critters automatically.
