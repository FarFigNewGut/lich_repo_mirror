Title : searchrepo
Date : 9/26/2019, 12/4/2016, 11/13/2018
Author : Luxelle
Game: Any
Tags : search, repo, repository, tags, names, find, scripts, luxelle, locate, uploads, author
Version : 1.2

Details :
 - Performs 3 searches on the repository for you, one for filename, one for tags
 - Displays the listing of the matches
 - Use just one term at a time. This isn't fancy!
 - It'll save you from remembering the painstaking repository search syntax

Use :
   ;searchrepo word
   ;searchrepo luxelle
   ;searchrepo multi
 
 Notes :
  - Absolutely so basic, you don't need to know or do anything else
  - Do note that you should try another search term if your first one comes up empty.
    Tagging does not always happen with uploads, hence why it searches both by tag and filename

Changelog :
  - v 1.2 released 26 Sept 2019 with syntax support for ? and a blank search term
  - v 1.1 released to the wild 13 Nov 2018 - you can now search by author, too
  - v 1.0 released to the wild 4 Dec 2016
