grgvars.lic, tag-along script for storing personal preferences for grguild.lic
for grguild.lic versions 7-28-10 and later
this script will autorun when grguild.lic is run.
This script must be trusted.
This script must be manually modified in order to set personal preferences.
Yes, that involves opening a file and changing code. Sorry fuckers, no GUI here.

# The script is an endless loop of stunmans until you can't do stunmans anymore.
# Set any of the following to false to stop it from attempting tasks in that skill.
# If a promotion is available, and you must diversify, the script will set that skill to false.
# That setting will remain until the next running of grgvars.lic.
