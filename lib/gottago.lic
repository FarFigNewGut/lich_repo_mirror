I use this as a panic button script for if I need to stop paying attention.

You'll need to modify it for your own situation.  This will not work out of the box.

I use a script called restroutine which manages my bigshot resting scripts.  
It is basically a collection of if statements and Script.runs.  I am
not uploading it because it is highly customized, but if you want to use this
script as written you should put an if statement at the top of your restroutine.lic
which looks something like this:
	if $gottago == true
		respond "emergency detected: exiting routine"
		kill_script("bigshot")
		exit
	end
I personally don't want my restroutine firing off a bunch of selling and sorting and 
spelling scripts while I am AFK.

You can use the $gottago variable in other scripts to monitor for an emergency condition

Remember to ";e $gottago = false" to clear this when you want to go back to normal.  I 
use an alias for that.

Requires go2table.
