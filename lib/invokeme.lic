    !!!!!IF THE INVOKER IS CURRENTLY PRESENT IN FWI!!!!!
    This script will:
    1. Return you to the closest town using ;go2 town 
    2. Use the command you have stored in ;vars under fwicommand to send you to FWI.
    3. Go to the bank on FWI.
    4. Withdraw 10000 silvers in coin (No need to empty your hands)
    5. Go to the Invoker on FWI.
    6. Ask the invoker for spells twice
    7. Use the command you have stored in ;vars under fwicommand to send you back to to where you came 
       from.
    8. Use ;go2 town to take you to the nearest town's node. (Usually the Town Center.)
    If she's not there, this script will set you up at your town's node in an extremely roundabout way with 
    10000 silvers in your pocket.
