This is an rnum edit by Xanlin.

* Append the Lich room ID# to your in-game room title.
* Ex: [Gyldemar Forest, Outpost - 4740]
* -Geldan

What's the edit? I use this on my voln characters to keep Voln Seeking from bleeding into my familiar window. 

Why? Because it's a hook that's already looking for and doing something to this server string. Not looking for the same thing twice, makes sense. Less hooks, better performance.

You can autostart this script even if you have the original rnum on a global autostart, this will kill rnum for you.

#I run rnum as a global autostart, and I only need this on my voln character, so it kills rnum
