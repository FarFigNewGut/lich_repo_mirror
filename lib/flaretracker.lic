require 'yaml'
=begin
This script tracks and analyzes damage output and flare performance, with a primary focus on newly introduced lore flares. It monitors both direct damage hits and various types of flares, calculating real-time statistics like DPS (damage per second), average damage, high scores, and flare rates (expressed as both a percentage and "1 flare per X swings"). The script displays this data in the familiar window, providing easy-to-read output with consistent formatting.

The script is especially useful for solo players using melee or ranged weapons, as it reliably tracks flare activity and performance in those situations. While it works well for standard weapon attacks, it may have difficulty tracking damage from spells due to the variety of messaging formats. The script has not yet been tested with unarmed combat (UAC). By offering detailed flare statistics, the script helps players optimize their gear and strategy by understanding the frequency and impact of different flares.

Script created with Chat GPT.

1.0.0 (2024-08-26)
    - Initial release of the damage tracking script.
    - Added support for tracking multiple flare types, including newly introduced lore flares.
    - Implemented real-time DPS tracking, high score, average damage, and flare rate calculation.
    - Displays detailed statistics in the familiar window.
    - Automatically saves damage data and high scores between sessions.

1.1.0 (2024-08-26)
    - Improved spacing and alignment for output in the familiar window.
    - Adjusted flare type names to ensure consistent alignment.
    - Increased the field width for "Flare Rate" to prevent truncation.
    - Credit to Tysong for fixing the familiar window spacing output.
