Project: Jfreedeed

Jfreedeed is a script that will take you to Landing bank and withdraw a 50k note.  (Encumbrance reasons)

Half-Krolvins will withdraw 75k note.  (Sorry!) 

It will take you to the caravansary, buy 5 rubies and get deeds at the Landing temple.

Level 100 characters will see sharp diminishing returns past 40 deeds.

Original concept of script derived from 10deeds.

***As of 9/1/23 there's a calculation issue with obtaining deeds in the Landing, some rubies just won't count.  Devs have been made aware.

Free accounts will get 5 deeds using this script since they seem to be charged more.  It will deposit any change from your note.
