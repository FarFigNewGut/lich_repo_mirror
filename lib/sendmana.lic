  Purpose: The purpose of this script is to continually send any mana you have to another character. You will still need to be watching
  	and responding on this character but it will check to see if you mana is above 0 (or your reserve amount) and	if so will send your
  	current mana (minus your reserve) to the recipient.
  	
  Syntax: ;sendmana <recipient>
					or
					;sendmana <recipient> <amount of mana to reserve>
  
  It will keep sending as long as it is successfully able to send when you have mana.
  If the recipient becomes "full", your mana control skill and that of the recipient is not enough to successfully transfer 
  or the recipient is not in the room when it tries to send, it will exit and stop running
