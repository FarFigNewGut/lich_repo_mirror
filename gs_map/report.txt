29106 [The Peaceful Porpoise, Portico] Kraken's Fall (u7118386)
  added description: Thin rivulets run down the spiralled flutings of columns framing the vestibule's entry, the water flowing into seaglass-filled channels carved into marble floors leading toward a driftwood arch.  Petrified coral sconces with flickering cerulean candles accent a mosaic crafted from broken shells spanning rockface walls.  Cut into these same walls is an opening leading to a small nook.
