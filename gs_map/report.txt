35680 [Seat of Storms, Base] Sailor's Grief (u7150721)
  added description: Worn away by the powerful rush of draining seawater, a yawning sinkhole in the stone lets cold starlight glimmer across the damp surface of the girthy support column beneath the sprawling disc of variegated blue stone.  Its rugged edges offer purchases necessary to scale the distance to the surface of the disc.  Bordered by towering barriers of fathomless ocean held back by invisible forces, the perch offers improbable glimpses of sealife surging and darting through the depths.
