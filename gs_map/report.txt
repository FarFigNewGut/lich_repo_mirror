{"id"=>35852, "title"=>["[Hollowlair, Den of the Fiend]"], "description"=>["Channels burrowed into the walls, floor, and ceiling of the chamber house glowing black runes, carved and barbed with razern.  The entire room appears caught within the Ur-Daemon's grasp, with Marlu's form looming over it.  Manacled and shackled chains line the walls, are mounted to the ceiling and floor, which is marked by a series of drains.  From the horrific stench, undoubtedly a result of the fetid and festering flesh on the restraints and clogging the drains, there seems to be no escape other than a barbed stone door."], "paths"=>["Obvious exits: out"], "location"=>"Sonreeva", "wayto"=>{"32281"=>"out"}, "timeto"=>{"32281"=>0.2}}
