  added description: Hard-looking sylvankind and half-krolvin trappers, burdened with pelts and furs from the wilds beyond, trudge southeast toward the local furrier.  A raw timber cottage faces the street, the snow cleared from its front path.  The trilling of a flute drifts from the cottage's doorway, gently punctuating the din of the bazaar to the east.

  added description: Verdant and clad in fresh snowfall, the dense pine forest gives way to a large clearing near the mouth of a high pass.

Each of the totems bears a different face, but all stare mutely, patiently standing watch despite the grinding of time's cruel teeth.  The largest is immense, several times the height of a tall man, but most are merely huge and imposing.

Their sprawling estates are dotted with pine trees, and in one yard, a garden full of colorful flowers thrives near the banks of a steaming hot spring.  One manse at the northernmost edge of the circle has gates of pale holly inlaid with walnut, a path of flagstones beyond shaded by old pine trees festooned with bright garlands."], "paths"=>["Obvious paths: south"], "location"=>"Icemule Trace", "wayto"=>{"2469"=>"south"}, "timeto"=>{"2469"=>0.2}, "uid"=>[4042327]}
