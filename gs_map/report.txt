25899 [Summit Academy, South Ellipse] Summit Academy (u8211303)
  added description: A current of warm air flows from the walkway that winds south beneath an arched canopy of trees.  As it mixes with the frosty air, a constant breeze swirls through the area.  A narrow flagstone path splits as it leads to both a tile-roofed manor house and a thatch-roofed cobblestone cottage.

Deep violet banners hang between tall windows, each bearing the sigil of crossed blades in pale thread.  Weapon stands flank the walls, holding blunted practice arms and paired dueling sabres.

One side holds neat rows of instructional tomes, their spines worn and titles stamped in silver leaf.  Opposite, velvet-lined niches cradle medallions bearing the names and crests of past masters, each polished to a soft gleam.
