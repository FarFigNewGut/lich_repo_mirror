2386 [Icemule Trace, West Road] Icemule Trace (u4042101)
  added description: Between a pair of barbican towers, a constant stream of halfling farmers from the Olbin Strath and richly dressed human traders from Briarmoon Cove flows through the West Gate, with the occasional krolvin crew scattered among them.  Town guards inspect cargo, sharply dressed in dark blue and brown leathers emblazoned with the rampant mule that is the town's sigil.  Outside of the gates, the land is spotted with scraggly grasses and snows, and there is little tree cover.

2455 [Icemule Trace, East Gate] Icemule Trace (u4042305)
  added description: Pack mules bray from wide hitching posts to either side of the East Gate, laden with luggage and gear from travelers fixing to brave the snowy wilderness.  Crowds pass through the barbican beyond, a peculiar mix of returning adventurers, weary merchants, and serene monks and sisters from the abbey to the east.  Several town guards stand watch in the darkness near the barbican towers, their eyes trained on the wilds beyond.

3436 [Tavern Burrow, Stout Street] Icemule Trace (u4042208)
    added title:   ["[Tavern Burrow, Stout Street]"]
  added description: A bright blue carpet fringed with silver tassels leads up to the entrance of a gaming hall, proceeding between two yew trees that have been trimmed into the shapes of mules and sprinkled with silvery powder.  A stout halfling in silver and blue livery bows low as would-be gamblers pass through the doors, an inviting smile on his lips.  An occasional shout of excitement erupts from within the hall as someone wins another hand.
