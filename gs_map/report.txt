2300 [Icemule Trace, Town Center] Icemule Trace (u4042150)
  added description: A bustling square dusted with snow sprawls beneath a sturdy mule statue standing placidly atop a tall plinth of silver-veined black stone.  The sun filters through the ice of the statue, showering the throng with a kaleidoscope of rainbowed shards.  Some denizens, mostly halflings but with a scattering of other folk mixed in, chatter by a roaring bonfire, lazing on a smooth dark stone bench or reclining on colorful cloaks spread out on the ground.  Others mill around a burled pine message board standing close to a colorful silver-bound barrel.

2301 [Icemule Trace, North Road] Icemule Trace (u4042022)
  added description: Crowds bustle along the cobblestone road, swirling past the entrance of an ornate stone edifice with stained glass windows, where several half-krolvin and giantkin loiter to await a merchant's arrival.  Several mages in colorful robes, all of them wearing scarves and mufflers, make their way westward, while a few priests in more muted cassocks congregate on their way to the temple, making signs of blessing at expectant women and small children.  Tall lamp posts, unlit during the day, proceed down the roadside in an alternating pattern.
--------------------------------------------------
2302 [Icemule Trace, South Road] Icemule Trace (u4042229)
  added description: The silvery sheen of a statue to the north glints merrily over the heads of most passersby.  Halflings and sylvankind in the deep blue elk hide livery of the Silvermule Gaming Hall rush past, messenger bags thumping against their sides as they race off to deliver letters and missives.  Most of the houses and businesses to either side of the street are built from grey stone, but their doors are brightly painted with a hodgepodge of colors.  An incongruous stone doorframe stands off to the side of the street.
--------------------------------------------------
2303 [Temple Burrow, Oleani Way] Icemule Trace (u4042001)
  added description: Homes line the road, their doors painted in a riot of colors.  The dwellings follow no set plan, ranging from stately pine lodges to round-doored burrows tucked into the sides of nearby hillocks.  One grey stone manse is secured by a black wrought iron gate.  Residents wander the road, waving to one another and stopping to converse.  A half-krolvin denizen stands on a ladder, carefully touching up the paint on a neighbor's roof while a gaggle of halflings shouts suggestions from below.
--------------------------------------------------
2304 [Temple Burrow, Oleani Way] Icemule Trace (u4042007)
  added description: Chunks of broken ice litter the cobblestone street near its intersection with a snow-covered stone path.  They glint like daggers in the chill sunlight.  Northward looms the glacier, its pale bulk rising above the rooftops of dwellings, the sun awakening ripples of vivid teal and murky green in its depths.  The same hues are repeated in the lacquer twining over the surface of a wrought iron gate, beyond which sprawls a splendid ice garden.
--------------------------------------------------
2305 [Temple Burrow, Oleani Way] Icemule Trace (u4042003)
  added description: Children dash down the street, filling the chilly air with high-pitched laughter.  Although many are halflings, there are just as many giantkin and half-krolvin among them.  They weave in spritely chases through the traffic before a snow-covered wooden lodge while a small coterie of sylvankind youths follows at a more sedate pace.  Several would-be merchants near to the lodge hawk rings and other tokens of affection.
--------------------------------------------------
2306 [Temple Burrow, Oleani Way] Icemule Trace (u4042004)
  added description: Trees dot the edge of the lane near the Empath Guild, pine and spruce clad in needles that are vividly verdant despite the cold.  The happy trilling of snow birds beckons from their snow-bent boughs.  One bird with bright golden and turquoise plumage sings loudly from atop a juniper laden with dark blue beries, noisily proclaiming his territory to all other avians in the vicinity.
--------------------------------------------------
2307 [Temple Burrow, Oleani Way] Icemule Trace (u4042010)
  added description: Near to the entrance to Hope Alley, three small cottages sit at a bend in the way.  Two occupy the south side of the lane, residing behind a wall carved with roses and stylized hearts.  The third, it appears, is being slowly overrun by the glacier.  An outcropping of solid ice jabs out over the rooftop, jutting from the glacier proper.  The owners seem little deterred by the intrusion, having dug a small upper story into the ice.
--------------------------------------------------
2308 [Temple Burrow, Oleani Way] Icemule Trace (u4042005)
  added description: The street ends in an ivy-covered building.  Restorative herbs grow in the window boxes, perfuming the icy air with their pungent aromas.  A polished modwir sign hangs from the roof of the building, suspended by bright gold chains twined with creeping vines.  Geckos no longer than a halfling's finger cling to the vines, catching insects happily.  At the side of the shop, some empty wooden buckets are filled with dirt.  Several varieties of coldleaf tobacco flourish in the makeshift planters.
--------------------------------------------------
2318 [Temple Burrow, Cholen Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042009)
  added description: A glassy sheet of ice slicks half of the cobblestone street.  Several homes on the north side are dug into the ice of the encroaching glacier, lights from within making the surrounding slope glow with golden hues.  Carvings decorate the lintels of the doors, and several houses display small ice statues on their roofs.  One yard sports a small snowman with a crooked carrot for a nose.
--------------------------------------------------
2319 [Temple Burrow, Koar and Cholen] Icemule Trace (u4042014)
  added description: Koar Street ends in an ice-slicked hill that rises to merge with the town's outer wall.  The glacier stretches out over the road, blocking view of the sky, though street lamps with bases fashioned in the shapes of dancing figures illuminate the shrouded span.  Priests wearing the symbols of several orders come and go through an iron-gated tunnel in the ice, though some fill the cavernous space with their murmurs as they stand talking quietly with one another.  At the road's end, a frosted silver gate leads into a walled courtyard.
    added paths:   ["Obvious exits: southwest, west"]
--------------------------------------------------
2320 [Temple Burrow, Koar Street] Icemule Trace (u4042013)
  added description: The well-traveled road is flanked by an orderly procession of street lamps, their bases carved with thunderbolts and bearded figures with severe countenances.  Priests in blue robes wander up and down a staircase carved from the side of the glacier.  It and the ice of the road are rough enough to easily traverse without falling.  A few small burrows are carved into the ice, round doors facing the street and painted with all of the hues of the dawn.
--------------------------------------------------
2321 [Temple Burrow, Cholen Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042008)
  added description: Temple guards with cowled heads dot the scattered crowd of blue-robed monks meandering up and down a broad path over one of the glacier's lesser slopes.  Houses with walls of heavy stone face the glacier's rise.   Some trail sweet-smelling woodsmoke from their chimneys, while others favor earthy peat for their cookfires.  The two fuel sources linger on the whipping winds in a potent melange.
--------------------------------------------------
2322 [Temple Burrow, Lumnis Street] Icemule Trace (u4042017)
  added description: Several initiates from the abbey pass by a large hill of snow and ice on their way deeper into town.  A small path climbs toward a natural hollow at the top of the hill.  Lamp posts flank the cobblestone road, proceeding eastward, where excited shrieks and giggles ring out over the driven snows.
--------------------------------------------------
2323 [Temple Burrow, Lumnis Street] Icemule Trace (u4042018)
  added description: War engulfs the end of the street as halflings and giantkin of all ages fling packed snowballs at one another.  Battle lines have been drawn in abutting yards, where several forts of snow have been erected to provide respite for some of the sodden combatants.  One entrepreneurial halfling lingers at the sidelines, selling towels to both sides, but his wares seem to be only marginally dry.
--------------------------------------------------
2324 [Temple Burrow, Ice Cave] Icemule Trace (u4042021)
  added description: The air within the cave is very still, as if the glacier is holding its frosty breath.  Icicles dip from the ceiling, refracting the radiance of the sun from outside into kaleidoscopic patterns that suffuse the walls with rainbowed light.  The cave seems far from the bustle of town, offering a pristine spot to sit a moment and ponder.
--------------------------------------------------
2325 [Temple Burrow, Lumnis Street] Icemule Trace (u4042016)
  added description: Serene silence blankets the roadway, broken only by the gentle babbling of ice water dripping from a runnel in the glacier to splash the base of one of the accompanying street lamps.  Most of the hustle and bustle is confined to the nearby temple, leaving the roadway lightly peopled.  A subtle pattern of interlocking rings, lightly rimed with icy filigree, is picked out in the cobblestones.
--------------------------------------------------
2329 [Temple Burrow, Cholen Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042002)
  added description: An unlit street light casts its shadow down the drive of a freshly built house, the construction new enough that boards and buckets of nails clutter the street before it.  Several weary-looking krolvin and halflings sit together near the entrance, their hair dusted with wood shavings and their clothing spotted with paint.  Lamp posts follow the winding lane, their wrought iron bases detailed with fanciful sculptings of musicians and dancers.
--------------------------------------------------
2330 [Temple Burrow, Cholen Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042006)
  added description: A small red brick schoolhouse brightens the area, the pealing of the bell filling the wintry air.  Near the door, an old halfling schoolmistress corrals children, her face weary but her eyes bright.  The air is brisk, made chilly by the glacier to the north, and the flowers in the schoolyard are small and hardy.  Youngsters, or perhaps those merely young at heart, have pushed and rolled mounds of snow into an assortment of gelid creations ranging from penguins to burly giants with coal for eyes.
--------------------------------------------------
2331 [Temple Burrow, Koar Street] Icemule Trace (u4042011)
  added description: Cobbled road gives way to solid ice as the pathway scales the edge of one of the glacier's lesser slopes.  The ground is slippery, but halflings and the occasional sylvankind pedestrian seem unhindered as they make their way.  Dwellings and shops dug out of the ice are fronted by round doors with fresh coats of brightly colored paint, though there seems to be no clear consensus on which colors go together well and which clash.  An ice ramp of packed, grated ice leads up and to the east toward the temple.
--------------------------------------------------
2332 [Temple Burrow, Koar and Lumnis] Icemule Trace (u4042012)
  added description: The edge of the glacier offers a marvelous view of the walled town below, a mix of burrows in the ice and cold earth and shingled rooftops of aboveground dwellings.  The roads are slightly haphazard in layout, but they join eventually with four main streets sprouting from the town center.  Above towers the temple, carved from pure ice and radiant in the sunlight.  An ice ramp descends westward, while an ice staircase leads down to the east and some carved steps plunge to the northwest around an oddly shaped ice flow.
--------------------------------------------------
2356 [Temple Burrow, Lumnis Street] Icemule Trace (u4042015)
  added description: Escorted by lamp posts whose bases are adorned with linked rings, the road delves between two rises in the glacier.  Carved ice steps wind up toward the temple, which crowns the southeastern rise, while a simple trail mounts the opposing slope.  From up the trail comes a vigorous splashing sound.  Shopkeepers do business from burrows that delve down into the ice, and several families have even cut dwellings out of the glacier.
--------------------------------------------------
2357 [Temple Burrow, Penguin Hill] Icemule Trace (u4042019)
  added description: Cold and crystal clear, a small lake has formed at the peak of the hill, providing a popular spot for local wildlife to congregate.  A huge colony of penguins flourishes on the shores of the lake.  They waddle comically around the edge, preen themselves and one another, and dive after little silvery fish darting through the frigid waters.  A smooth runnel in the bank makes an ideal slide for the creatures and, it appears, some of the younger townsfolk.
--------------------------------------------------
2358 [Icemule Trace, North Road] Icemule Trace (u4042025)
  added description: The crowds attenuate near the northern boundary of the town, reduced to a few clerics headed east into the Temple Burrow and several stalwarts bound toward the northern gates.  Most everyone on the road wears thick boots and fur-lined cloaks, though a sprinkling of krolvin wear lighter clothing of hide with accoutrements of whalebone and sharktooth.   The glacier overshadows the roadway, its severe wall rising high above the streets, and the cobblestones are slippery with ice and tracked-in snow.
--------------------------------------------------
2359 [Icemule Trace, North Gate] Icemule Trace (u4042026)
  added description: Several town guards watch the northern gate of the town, which is little more than a chasm hollowed out of the encroaching glacier.  Though armed, the guards seem less focused on watching for foes from the ice and more on discouraging the unwary or unprepared from braving the frigid depths.  The faint shadow of what once must have been the actual gates is visible through the ice, evidently devoured during the glacier's unrelenting advance.  Some stairs cut into the ice leading up to the city walls climb the natural wall created by the ice.
--------------------------------------------------
2360 [Magical Burrow, Banshee Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042110)
  added description: A biting wind screeches down the lane from the east.  In that direction, in a break between the last houses on the street winks the glacial ice framing the northern gate of the town.  Past the entrance to Enchantment Alley, the road curves to the southwest, delving into the heart of the burrow.
--------------------------------------------------
2361 [Magical Burrow, Banshee Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042109)
  added description: Low-eaved houses line the street and residents, predominantly halflings and humans, bustle in and out of them.  Despite the chill in the air, a small group of children plays nearby, giggles chasing them as they run down the cobblestone lane.  They seem to shy away from the entrance to a dark and narrow alley between two especially ramshackle shops.
--------------------------------------------------
2362 [Magical Burrow, Wraith Road] Icemule Trace (u4042114)
  added description: Heavy fog encroaches upon the twisting, turning road, so thick as to obscure the cobblestones completely in places.  The lamp posts along the road have bases wrought in the forms of swirling wraiths with their talons outstretched, the figures doing little to dispel the ill look of the area.  Several houses have lanterns swinging from heavy iron chains over their doors, as if not entirely trusting the street lights to ward off darkness.
--------------------------------------------------
2364 [Magical Burrow, Wraith Road] Icemule Trace (u4042115)
  added description: Cold fog prowls along the cobblestones, so thick that travelers of shorter stature might be entirely engulfed by its dense banks.  It eddies away from the gated entrance of a villa set back from the street.  The entrance is chained shut and there are piles of construction materials stacked outside.

2365 [Magical Burrow, Wraith Road] Icemule Trace (u4042116)
  added description: Dense fog creeps over the street in heavy banks.  Hanging low to the ground, it swirls in a chilling caress, muting the footsteps of passerby and making the noises of the district sound distant and strange.  Wrought iron fences guard the stolid old estates along the sides of the street.  Their windows stare down like empty sockets, and even the burrows nearby are grim things with dark-painted doors.  One gate is partly askew, allowing access to the porch of a small house.

2366 [Magical Burrow, Banshee Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042107)
  added description: Small magical shops offering cure-all potions and other far-fetched elixirs line the narrow ribbon of cobblestone street.  Peddlers, the halfling ones standing atop crates to better their vantage and visibility, hawk their wares loudly and more quietly try to convince passersby of their authenticity.  Only the occasional street lamp stands along the roadside, their bases fashioned in the shapes of hollow-eyed banshees, and the shadows of the lamp posts stretch long across the thoroughfare.
--------------------------------------------------
2367 [Magical Burrow, Demons Run] Icemule Trace (u4042111)
    added title:   ["[Magical Burrow, Demons Run]"]
  added description: Shadows stretch long and tenebrous along the crooked span of cobblestones.  Short dark houses lurk down winding drives, their snowy yards guarded by intricately patterns fences of wrought iron.  There is a chill in the air that is not entirely born from the frigid breeze that howls down the lane, moaning low in the spaces between homes.
--------------------------------------------------
2368 [Magical Burrow, Demons Run] Icemule Trace (u4042112)
    added title:   ["[Magical Burrow, Demons Run]"]
  added description: Cold wind moans down the lonesome street, feeling as if it is blowing right off of the glacier itself.  The chill in the air and the tightly shuttered windows of the houses make the stretch of road an unwelcoming one.  A whiff of strange incense, woodsy and bitter, lingers on the wind, though its source is unclear.
--------------------------------------------------
2369 [Magical Burrow, Sage Bend] Icemule Trace (u4042117)
    added title:   ["[Magical Burrow, Sage Bend]"]
  added description: A mural stretches along the face of a low stone fence separating a nearby manor from the street.  Depicted in vivid paint is a battle between ten small, dark figures with stretching shadows and a brave force of adventurers.  The leader of the tenebrous coterie is wreathed in twisting flames.  An ironwork gate opens out of the center of the fence, offering access to a welcoming if wintry courtyard beyond.
--------------------------------------------------
2370 [Magical Burrow, Demons Run] Icemule Trace (u4042113)
    added title:   ["[Magical Burrow, Demons Run]"]
  added description: Behind a tall mithril gate, a flagstone path winds toward a rushing stream, threading in the direction of a stately fieldstone building mostly obscured by intervening drifts of snow.  Figures in colorful robes wander through the entry, some supported by ornate staves of pine or even silvery hoarbeam.  Houses and storefronts give the estate a wide berth, mostly cleaving to the opposite side of the road.
--------------------------------------------------
2380 [Magical Burrow, Banshee Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042106)
  added description: Gloomy houses with steepled roofs spotted with snowfall join strange magic shops to both sides of the winding thread of cobblestone road.  Halflings and the occasional krolvin hurry by on their way to some place else.  Ragged tendrils of mist rise off of the ice and snow dotting the landscape, swirling in eddies around the entrance to Incantation Alley.

2381 [Magical Burrow, Illusionist Way] Icemule Trace (u4042120)
  added description: Narrowing to a tenuous thread of cobblestone, the street is crowded by huddled houses with snow-dusted yards.  Thick fog drapes the street, though the locals largely ignore its presence as they shuffle on their way to one task or another.  A brightly illuminated shop sits between a bank of snow and a corner street light, the sign above its entry swaying in the wintry air.

--------------------------------------------------
2382 [Underground Tunnel] Icemule Trace (u4042122)
  added description: Fog roils down from above, obscuring the uneven ground.  The tunnel's walls are hard earth, packed and frozen besides.  Hanging roots dip down from the rough ceiling, some fringed with spindly icicles.
--------------------------------------------------
2383 [Underground Tunnel] Icemule Trace (u4042123)
  added description: Roots dangle from the ceiling and snatch from the walls of the tunnel, old and nearly as unyielding as iron.  The fog choking the ground swirls and eddies, driven by the languorous air currents underground.  So cold is it below the earth that the walls have frozen.  They glisten darkly with a sheet of glassy ice.
--------------------------------------------------
2384 [Underground Tunnel] Icemule Trace (u4042124)
  added description: An acrid scent, not entirely natural, travels through the air in a biting undercurrent.  Tangled roots hang from the walls, while a few larger ones stretch across the ground, making the terrain difficult but not impassable.  Fog mostly conceals the obstacles, but here and there, a gnarled tangle breaches through the mist.  To the south, an opening in the roots offers access to a shop occupying a well-lit burrow.
--------------------------------------------------
2387 [Tavern Burrow, Pilsner Avenue] Icemule Trace (u4042221)
  added description: The Nightowl Pub stands at the end of Pilsner Avenue, the grimy windows along its north-facing facade looking out over the span of West Road.  A single lamp post stands out front, its base etched with a relief of spread-winged owls in flight.
--------------------------------------------------
2390 [Tavern Burrow, Pilsner Avenue] Icemule Trace (u4042220)
  added description: A small niche has been carved into an old stone wall fronting the street.  Dried flowers and small folded notes surround the opening.  A young woman kneels before the wall, a wedding bouquet in one hand.  The other presses against the wall so hard that its fingertips have whitened.
--------------------------------------------------
2391 [Tavern Burrow, Pilsner Avenue] Icemule Trace (u4042219)
  added description: Winterberry hedges grow at the base of a wrought iron fence enclosing the yard of some forging workshops located beyond a blued steel gate.  The greenery helps to muffle some of the repetitive clanging of metal on metal emanating from within the workshops.  A narrow alley, marked with a clever sign crafted from the top of a hogshead barrel, jags off to the northeast.
--------------------------------------------------
2392 [Tavern Burrow, Pilsner Avenue] Icemule Trace (u4042204)
  added description: In the shadow of the city's western wall stands a smithy, the door to its attached shop propped open by an oversized claidhmore.  White walls contrast tastefully with the dark blue trim of the windows and eaves and the sloping slate roof.  Through an open window, the clang of metal on metal and the effervescent smoke of burning pine drift out onto the street.  A green and gold imflass sign identifies the shop of Dalt Wineberry, one of the richest halflings in town.
--------------------------------------------------
2393 [Tavern Burrow, Bitters Bend] Icemule Trace (u4042203)
    added title:   ["[Tavern Burrow, Bitters Bend]"]
  added description: Near the shadow of the town walls, a stone-walled mill marks the southwestern corner of Icemule Trace.  Pilsner Avenue heads northward along the western wall, while Honeybeer Road leads eastward toward the South Gate, passing by a quaint neighborhood down a neat cobblestone path.  Bakers' apprentices pushing wheelbarrows full of grain or flour hustle to and from the mill tower.

--------------------------------------------------
2394 [Tavern Burrow, Honeybeer Road] Icemule Trace (u4042202)
  added description: A few small shops front Honeybeer Road, selling odds and ends.  One shop has a windowbox filled with colorful pinwheels that spin wildly whenever the wind blows, flashing their bright colors in a dizzying dance.  Another storefront's window is filled with a display of beer steins.  A carved spruce sign shaped like an arrow points toward the doorway of the local fletcher's shop.
--------------------------------------------------
2395 [Tavern Burrow, Honeybeer Road] Icemule Trace (u4042201)
  added description: The Honeybeer Inn is a homey, cheerful-looking tavern with low, broad eaves and two round dormer windows that overlook the street.  Smoke curls upward from the stone chimney.  The scent of roasting rolton drifts out of the oak door each time it opens.  A standing hoarbeam-framed slate stands out front to welcome customers.
--------------------------------------------------
2396 [Tavern Burrow, Honeybeer Road] Icemule Trace (u4042200)
  added description: A two-toned stone wall absorbs the heat of the sun.  A young couple leans against the warm stone as they share some piping hot tarts.  The sight of food, coupled with the smell of baked goods that lingers over the area, inspires some passing townsfolk to hurry along to the nearest bakeshop or pub.  A few glance over their shoulders as they skulk toward the entrance to Bootlegger's Alley.
--------------------------------------------------
2397 [Tavern Burrow, Porter Street] Icemule Trace (u4042206)
  added description: Two-story rowhouses painted in vivid colors line Porter Street.  On the steps of a blue and white house, an older halfling woman sits, peeling apples and watching the people passing by.  Opposite the homes, a colorful wooden sign hangs next to the door of a dyer's shop.  Several of the homes burn herbs in their windows to keep out the faint stench of the dyes.
--------------------------------------------------
2398 [Tavern Burrow, Porter Street] Icemule Trace (u4042207)
  added description: Porter Street angles sharply towards the northeast as if veering toward the Silvermule Gaming Hall.  Crowds push past on their way to gamble, krolvin and half-krolvin, giantkin and halflings alike united by the allure of easily attained riches.  Only a few seem to pay any mind to a small snow-covered shop on the corner.  The southern wall of Icemule Trace is just visible down a short lane heading south.
--------------------------------------------------
2399 [Tavern Burrow, Ale Street] Icemule Trace (u4042215)
  added description: Bright-berried yew trees line the street, muffling the sounds of merrymaking echoing from the nearby gaming hall.  The bright rowhouses of Porter Street give way to wider boarding houses with balconies protected by wrought iron rail.  One tennant flies a pennant of giantkin tartan, while another has a ship's flag draped from their balcony.
--------------------------------------------------
2400 [Tavern Burrow, Ale Street] Icemule Trace (u4042214)
  added description: A stucco well has attracted a small group of children, who drop stones into its depths and hoot with glee at each muffled splash.  Across the cobblestone street, an enterprising group of young toughs has erected a hoarbeam trestle table.  They work industriously at picking the chests and coffers of local adventurers, one lad sitting atop an old oak beer barrel.  Lighter cobbles on the road form the outline of a frothing tankard, and the nearest lamp posts have bases wrought in the shapes of dancing revelers.
--------------------------------------------------
2401 [Tavern Burrow, Lager Road] Icemule Trace (u4042224)
  added description: Lager Road turns slightly, bending away from a solitary building with boarded up windows.  The edifice's clapboards are grey and weathered, contrasting starkly with the raw wooden planks across the doors and windows.  It almost appears as though the building was transported intact from another town, then allowed to fall into disuse.
--------------------------------------------------
2402 [Tavern Burrow, Lager Road] Icemule Trace (u4042222)
  added description: A twisting staircase with slender wrought iron rails spirals precariously up the back of the Nightowl Pub.  The stairs climb to a small grated ledge just below an open window on the second story of the ramshackle building.  Empty hogsheads, still smelling of the beer they once contained, are stacked beneath the staircase, as if to provide a splintery cushion for anyone who might fall.
--------------------------------------------------
2403 [Tavern Burrow, Malt Road] Icemule Trace (u4042223)
  added description: The cobblestones of Malt Road alternate in whites and wan ambers reminiscent of a pale ale's hue.  Merry whistling lilts through the traffic along the road, which mostly consists of merchants and porters with cask-laden wagons bound for local taverns and inns.  Dried herbs hanging from the eaves of a rickety cottage impart a sweet fragrance to the cold wind.
--------------------------------------------------
2404 [Tavern Burrow, Barley Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042216)
  added description: The narrow rowhouses along Barley Lane are taller than most of the surrounding homes.  The eaves of the buildings are low and broad to shade their porches from the sun and keep walkways free of snow.  Lamp posts to either side of the road have bases etched with sheaves of barley.

  added description: Arms slung companionably over one another's shoulders, a group of halflings enters the Thirsty Penguin.  A mother cat rests on the broad stone step.  From beyond the swinging doors come the sounds of clinking mugs and hearty laughter.
--------------------------------------------------
2408 [Tavern Burrow, Stout Street] Icemule Trace (u4042212)
  added description: A jumble of boxes is piled at the base of a tall evergreen hedge where Stout Street meets Barley Lane.  Soft mewing from one of the boxes is almost obscured by the muffled drumbeats, soft arpeggios, and muted voices lifted in song at nearby taverns.  A gap in the hedge leads through a split-rail fence into the courtyard beyond.  The fence and hedge end at the corner of the property, where an easily overlooked side door serves as a side entrance to a nondescript building.
--------------------------------------------------
2409 [Icemule Trace, South Road] Icemule Trace (u4042228)
  added description: A narrow house juts out into the cobblestone thoroughfare as if displaced from where it ought to be by the sprawl of the gaming hall to the southwest.  The savory aroma of baked apples tantalizes from an open window at street level.  Less pleasant, though mostly muted by hanging nosegays of rosebay and bilberry, is the odor of dyes wafting from a colorful canvas pavilion on the opposite side of the road.

2410 [Icemule Trace, South Road] Icemule Trace (u4042227)
  added description: Occasional cheers of victory or groans of failure echo from the west, where the rooftop of the town's gaming hall glistens with a fresh tracing of silvery ice.  Several newcomers to town, standing out due to their foreign garb and lack of layered clothing, filter through the doors of a stone cottage.  A few crafty young krolvin linger outside, plying them for spare silvers.
--------------------------------------------------
2411 [Icemule Trace, South Road] Icemule Trace (u4042226)
  added description: Halfling and giantkin vendors hawk their wares along the sides of the busy thoroughfare, the former cohort frequently standing atop crates and soapboxes so as not to be lost in the crowd.  A troop of half-krolvin trappers makes their way through the throng, coins jingling in their pockets.  Though drifts of fresh-fallen snow dot the roadside, a wrought iron street lamp at the corner stands near a cleared path, occasionally serving as a resting post for weary travelers.
--------------------------------------------------
2412 [Icemule Trace, South Road] Icemule Trace (u4042225)
  added description: A flow of adventurers, merchants, trappers, and lumberjacks congeals into a noisy throng near the South Gate of Icemule Trace.  Adding to the clack of wagon wheels and the din of the crowd, sounds of laughter and clanking mugs beckon from the inns and taverns that occupy the Tavern Burrow, just to the west.   The road lies in the shadow of the town's high walls and barbican towers, the foundations of which are of darker stone than the top.
--------------------------------------------------
2413 [Commerce Burrow, Trader Way] Icemule Trace (u4042321)
    added title:   ["[Commerce Burrow, Trader Way]"]
  added description: A brisk wind blows down the street, shivering the branches of evergreens along the roadside.  The road comes to a sharp corner in front of a marvelous two-story bakery.  Countless small windows with white shutters peek out of the brick facade of the shop, and a polished silver plaque is affixed next to the door.  Woodsmoke billows gently from the stone chimney, though its bite is sweetened by the aroma of baked goods.

    added title:   ["[Commerce Burrow, Trader Way]"]
  added description: The enticing aroma of baked goods wafts in from the south, luring a steady stream of travelers toward a bakery there that stands a story taller than the other businesses along the street.  Several halflings coming from that direction clutch tarts with a delectable variety of fillings in parchment wrappings, the pastries still piping hot.  Near a windblown leather tent sporting a sign etched with carved logs, an alley juts off of the main drag.
--------------------------------------------------
2415 [Commerce Burrow, Krolvin Alley] Icemule Trace (u4042317)
    added title:   ["[Commerce Burrow, Krolvin Alley]"]
  added description: Wedged into a cramped walk between two tall buildings, the alley slumbers in shadow.  The brick wall behind a stack of empty crates is scrawled with an ugly symbol in dark brown pigment that looks like a harpy wreathed by a burning ring.  Soft scuttling resounds from within the crates.  Despite the unappealing locale, a grungy little shop does brisk business near the midpoint of the alleyway.
--------------------------------------------------
2416 [Commerce Burrow, Krolvin Alley] Icemule Trace (u4042322)
    added title:   ["[Commerce Burrow, Krolvin Alley]"]
  added description: Twisting and turning between weathered buildings of brick and pine, the cobbled alley slopes steeply downward.  Dense shadows lurk to either side of the walkway.  As if oblivious to the foreboding look of the span, an elegant little shop opens onto the alleyway, hand-drawn maps of locales familiar and foreign on display through its wide bay windows.
--------------------------------------------------
2418 [Commerce Burrow, Krolvin Alley] Icemule Trace (u4042323)
    added title:   ["[Commerce Burrow, Krolvin Alley]"]
  added description: A tall, brightly painted building stands at the end of the alleyway.  Banners of red, blue, yellow, and green wool dangle from the awnings, rustling slightly in the breeze.  Finely dressed halflings bustle past, their arms loaded with bright packages from the clothier's shop, while a space between two storefronts dovetails into another alley.

  added description: A group of sylvankind tightens cloaks in woodland hues against the chill wind off of the glacier as they glide down the street.  Towering high over the road, the town wall stands between the niceties of civilization and the cruel beauty of the wilds beyond.  In the shadow of the wall stands a gem shop, a sturdy stone building bearing a shiny gold plaque.  Gems and jewelry glimmer from the windows on beds of black velvet.

    added title:   ["[Commerce Burrow, Trader Way]"]
  added description: Peddlers from out of Briarmoon Cove and Pinefar wander up and down the road, loudly touting their wares.  A general store sits to the side of the road, decorated with banners in a cheerful rainbow of colors.  The customers are an eclectic mix of fledgling adventurers and townsfolk, the two groups united in their need for various odds and ends.
--------------------------------------------------
2426 [Icemule Trace, East Road] Icemule Trace (u4042301)
  added description: A pair of town guards are stationed outside the archway leading into the town's bank.  One halfling guard seems to be dozing on his stool, while the other keeps a close and wary eye on the foot traffic flowing past.  The bank is a tall building, its clapboard exterior painted a bright wintry blue that complements its dark slate-shingled roof.  Several krolvin sailors count their money nearby, using the top of an old oaken hogshead to stack coins familiar and strange.
--------------------------------------------------
2427 [Icemule Trace, East Road] Icemule Trace (u4042302)
  added description: As it passes by a half-timbered pale grey stone guildhall, the straight march of the cobblestone road offers a view of snowy foothills beyond the town's walls.  Over the heads of fur-clad merchants from Pinefar and robed sisters leading groups of fresh-faced initiates out of town, the snow-swept wilds are dotted with evergreens and dark rock.  Glimpses of a pale stone abbey in the extreme distance are almost entirely lost to the cloud cover.  To the south, the slate-shingled roof of Clovertooth Hall rises high into the sky.
--------------------------------------------------
2428 [Commerce Burrow, Sylvan Hollow] Icemule Trace (u4042307)
  added description: Paved with cobblestones, a wide cul-de-sac spreads before Clovertooth Hall, the civic center of the bustling town.  Meticulously clean windows sparkle to either side of the wide, arched entry, the keystone of which is stamped with a mule in bright copper inlay.  The slate shingles of the building are tidy and even, and they are sealed with pine pitch.  High-topped spruce trees with verdant needles dusted by fresh snow frame the circle, softening the sounds of peddlers and foot traffic along the road to the north.
--------------------------------------------------
2451 [Icemule Trace, East Road] Icemule Trace (u4042303)
  added description: Adventurers thread through the crowd cluttering the eastbound road, ornate weapons and flamboyant attire standing out from the more common furs and wool worn by merchants and locals.  Young halfling and human children run around near the street, tugging at travelers' coattails in an effort to hawk cheap gems.  Wooden building sits amidst the chaos, its yard heaped with crates, barrels, and trunks, while a well-lit dark stone shop seems to have taken a more reserved approach, standing away from the busy throng.

  added description: Tall brownstone rowhouses line both sides of the busy road, their round doors painted a wide variety of colors.  A gnarled birch hunches over the southern edge of the road, its roots snaking beneath the cobblestones and its bark lending the breeze a pleasant bite.  Beneath the tree, a scattering of bright green leaves litters the ground.  The bent stalwart marks the property line of a small snow-covered cottage standing back from the thoroughfare.
--------------------------------------------------
2455 [Icemule Trace, East Gate] Icemule Trace (u4042305)
  added description: Pack mules bray from wide hitching posts to either side of the East Gate, laden with luggage and gear from travelers fixing to brave the snowy wilderness.  Crowds pass through the barbican beyond, a peculiar mix of returning adventurers, weary merchants, and serene monks and sisters from the abbey to the east.  A group of halfling children plays a game by the barbican towers, daring one another to run out into the wilds beyond.
--------------------------------------------------
2456 [Commerce Burrow, Dwarven Circle] Icemule Trace (u4042309)
  added description: The windows of the town's jail look out over the road, the bars guarding them filigreed with silvery rime.  Across the road from the jail, a dark-eyed halfling leans against the wall of a barrister's office and quietly observes the passerby.  A rocky path winds toward the jailhouse's door, passing by a large boulder with a few crude etchings on its surface.
--------------------------------------------------
2457 [Icemule Trace, Jailhouse Path] Icemule Trace (u4042326)
  added description: There are garden plots along the walls to either side of the jail entrance, a sturdy steel door etched with a dour-looking mule.  The hardy herbs and flowers growing in the cold soil lend the gloomy structure a glimmer of natural beauty.  The jailhouse path bends around a large boulder that is worn smooth by the elements.  The rock's sheer size suggests that its presence might predate the town around it.
--------------------------------------------------
2459 [Commerce Burrow, Dwarven Circle] Icemule Trace (u4042310)
  added description: Several townhouses stand along the cobblestone street.  Their neatly manicured yards are home to fine-looking statuary, and all are kept meticulously clear of snow, suggesting that they are the residences of well-to-do merchants and other luminaries of the town.  Smaller homes front a nearby alley, while an arched gate leads to a less prosperous neighborhood lazing beneath the town's outer wall.  A young halfling girl sweeps the walk in front of one of the homes, hurrying to complete her daily chores.
--------------------------------------------------
2460 [Commerce Burrow, Dwarven Circle] Icemule Trace (u4042315)
  added description: A riotous throng crowds the entrance of a large grey tent with a ten-foot long rat tail on top.  Standing atop a wooden crate, a halfling rogue dressed in fine grey leathers stands in front of a sign depicting a wheel of cheese.  Paying little mind to the untenable size of the crowd that his establishment has already amassed, he exhorts passerby to come closer, only adding to the horde.

2461 [Commerce Burrow, Dwarven Circle] Icemule Trace (u4042320)
  added description: Most of the shops along the way are prosperous two-story storefronts with clear glass windows and stately porches.   Fine furnishings glint in the candlelight from within a long wooden building near the end of the row.  Near the end of its freshly plowed front walk, a young trapper toils at the side of the road, pulling on a heavy sack of fresh skins.
--------------------------------------------------
2462 [Commerce Burrow, Dwarven Circle] Icemule Trace (u4042319)
  added description: Bumblefinger's Pawnshop is perched on the south side of the road, the well-tended wooden building draped with several blue and green banners proclaiming its low prices and fine goods.  Several giantkin mill about outside, counting their coins.  Freshly painted some white stairs climb up to the pawnshop porch.
--------------------------------------------------
2465 [Commerce Burrow, Dwarven Circle] Icemule Trace (u4042318)
  added description: The stink of tanning solution and uncured hides sours the air, barely fettered by the presence of floral sachets in the windows of nearby shops.  Trappers wait in line outside the furrier's shop that is the odor's obvious source, most carrying pelts, but a few laboring beneath the weight of a whole carcass.  Hanging from the thatched roof of the shop is a bright blue banner.
--------------------------------------------------
2467 [Commerce Burrow, Giantman Path] Icemule Trace (u4042324)
  added description: A quiet path veers south of the bazaar along a residential street fronted by homes of all shapes and sizes.  Rowhouses stand by small manses owned by some of the town's wealthiest denizens.  The sounds of the town are muffled by the thatched roofs of several houses, aided in the effort by evergreens growing along the road.  A fountain burbles in the courtyard of a tall brick building near the far end of the road.
--------------------------------------------------
2468 [Commerce Burrow, Giantman Path] Icemule Trace (u4042325)
  added description: Surrounded by a small field of snow-dotted grass, an ancient oak tree marks the southeastern boundary of the town.  Its highest branches tower above the outer wall, and from within, a songbird cries, filling the air with its gentle twittering.  The old stalwart's roots have dug beneath the wall's foundations, tirelessly working at them until the very stones have surrendered to their efforts.
--------------------------------------------------
2470 [Commerce Burrow, Bazaar] Icemule Trace (u4042313)
  added description: A dizzying assortment of colorful tents and booths crowds the cobbles of the bazaar.  Farm stands selling produce from the Olbin Strath stand shoulder to shoulder with the bright silk pavilions of merchants out of Briarmoon Cove.  The savory aroma of roasting rolton weds tantalizingly with the sweetness of fresh-baked tarts on the chilly air.  One wooden warehouse along the perimeter is festooned with garlands, though many of the flowers are dusted with ice crystals.

  added description: Flamboyantly dressed merchants, many of them halflings but with a scattering of half-krolvin, humans, and giantkin mixed in, rest from their work and devour local delicacies at large round tables scattered around the center of the bazaar.  Off to the edges, more peddler's booths and tents in raucous colors stand, their owners selling exotic spices, bright copper pots and pans, and everything in between.  A dainty shop stands back from the fray, sedate in comparison to the throng despite its sky blue roof.
--------------------------------------------------
2472 [Commerce Burrow, Dwarven Circle] Icemule Trace (u4042308)
  added description: The shouts of traders drift over the slate-shingled rooftops of the shops to the south.  Evidently unbothered by the noise, an ancient halfling sits on a bench along the side of the road.  He twirls a slender blue wand between his fingers while lecturing to a group of young, attentive pupils.

3223 [Tavern Burrow, Barley Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042218)
  added description: The simple design and ramshackle look of wooden boarding houses along the road suggest that the occupants belong to the burrow's working class.  A number of the buildings have oiled parchment tacked over their windows to block out intrusive light.  Two young halfling girls sit on the front steps of one of the houses.
--------------------------------------------------
3230 [Icemule Trace, West Road] Icemule Trace (u4042102)
  added description: Rowdy shouts from customers in taverns and the gaming hall cut through the din of foot traffic along the road, making the burrows and above-ground shops to the north seem almost too quiet by comparison.  Stately street lights of wrought iron proceed to either side of the cobblestone road.  Those to the south have bases fashioned into the shapes of halflings holding tankards and ale mugs aloft, while their northern counterparts are robed or cowled, bearing wands and staves.
--------------------------------------------------
3231 [Icemule Trace, West Road] Icemule Trace (u4042103)
  added description: Most of the businesses to either side of the cobblestone road have facades of raw pine, though there are a few of stone.  Still more are dug out of the frozen earth of abounding hillsides.  Most have round doors painted with bright colors.  To the east, the foot traffic thickens as the road strikes toward the heart of town.  It seems especially busy where the road dovetails into a cobblestone walkway leading to a spacious courtyard framed by lofty trees, the windblown needles of which dot the landscape.
--------------------------------------------------
3233 [Icemule Trace, West Road] Icemule Trace (u4042105)
  added description: Travelers crowd the road, making it difficult to traverse without the occasional bump or jostle.  They crowd the entrance of a small fired brick building, an obstacle to the message runners in the deep blue elk hides commonly worn by local couriers.  Wagons drawn by surly mules struggle to make their way toward the town's central square in the east, completely stymied by the foot traffic.
--------------------------------------------------
3305 [Icemule Trace, North Road] Icemule Trace (u4042023)
  added description: Wind gusts down from the north, chilling the air along the roadway.  Sunshine reflects brilliantly off of the glacier, blazing like a beacon in the pale daylight.  Above, the temple rises above the town on a hill of colorless ice, watching over the city and shining like polished crystal.  Carillons sound in the distance, their imperious pealing rising above even the din of the road.
--------------------------------------------------
3306 [Icemule Trace, North Road] Icemule Trace (u4042024)
  added description: Sheets of glassy ice slick the street, forcing foot traffic to the margins of the road, where the bases of lamp posts depict circles of halflings holding hands.  The glacier looms over the northern gates and its icy slopes have intruded into the town to either side.  Ctizens have taken this in stride, and have dug burrows into the ancient ice.  Their round, painted doors dot the slopes.
--------------------------------------------------
3351 [Magical Burrow, Illusionist Way] Icemule Trace (u4042121)
  added description: The street is barely wide enough for a mule-drawn cart to make its way.  Dark houses line both sides of the street, punctuated by the occasional burrow.  All appear well-to-do, with spacious estates whose high walls permit glimpses of ice gardens and hedge mazes flanking their drives.  Fog blankets everything, transforming nearby trees into silhouettes with snatching black claws.
--------------------------------------------------
3353 [Magical Burrow, Sorcerer Way] Icemule Trace (u4042118)
    added title:   ["[Magical Burrow, Sorcerer Way]"]
  added description: Cold breezes sneak along the street, shivering the branches of pine trees in the abounding yards.  Small burrows with doors painted in vibrant reds or stark blacks occupy the faces of flanking hillocks, but there are just as many above-ground dwellings.  Most have a vaguely unwelcoming look, though one brick home has a small orchard of wintercrisp apple trees out front.  The few lamp posts along the way have bases depicting robed figures with shrouded features.
--------------------------------------------------
3354 [Magical Burrow, Sorcerer Way] Icemule Trace (u4042119)
    added title:   ["[Magical Burrow, Sorcerer Way]"]
  added description: Hanging from a wooden arm above the tall double doors of a nearby shop, a white holly sign creaks in the restless wind howling down the way.  A small pathway of brightly colored gravel leads through the front gate, snaking past a few stunted alder trees.  Although the windows of the storefront are shuttered, periodic bursts of light shine through their wooden slats to illuminate the entire street.
--------------------------------------------------
3356 [Magical Burrow, Banshee Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042108)
  added description: The lane swerves between a row of rickety shops occupied by merchants trafficking in wares mundane, magical, and outright preposterous.  Not all of the structures are permanent, as the storefronts are joined by tents and the occasional covered wagon.  One stand sports a fresh coat of white paint and a brightly polished brass sign.
--------------------------------------------------
3358 [Temple Burrow, Icy Pool] Icemule Trace (u4042020)
  added description: Penguins churn the frigid pool.  They swim through the limpid waters, diving and splashing with a comedic flair that provokes uproarious laughter from onlookers on the banks.  The water is freezing cold, but the birds do not seem to mind in the slightest.  To the side, an icy ledge offers a way out of the gelid drink.

  added description: The narrow landing is wrought from the same metal as the staircase, though its surface is grated to provide a glimpse of the street below.  Though thin, the railings seem sturdy enough to support the weight of most humanoids.  Whispers, giggles, and the occasional feather drift onto the landing from an open window at the back of the pub.
--------------------------------------------------
3429 [Tavern Burrow, Stout Street] Icemule Trace (u4042209)
  added description: The rear entrance to the gaming hall is nearly as resplendent as its main one.  Espaliered wintercrisp apple trees grow to either side of the massive dark modwir doors.  Bright green apples weigh down their branches, but not a single fruit has been suffered to splatter the cobblestones below.  A smiling attendant in silver and blue waves at passerby.

  added description: An unofficial moneychanger does brisk business at the corner, moving from streetcorner to streetcorner to avoid contact with town officials.  Brightly colored banners in silver and blue fly from surrounding windows, proclaiming the way to various local establishments.  Across the way, a low-roofed stone guard post is surrounded by a spade-tipped fence with a heavy wrought iron gate.
--------------------------------------------------
3438 [Tavern Burrow, Honeybeer Road] Icemule Trace (u4042210)
  added description: At the busy intersection of Stout Street and Honeybeer Road, the smell of roasting meats drifts from the west on a cold breeze.  The whistling of a traveling merchant rises over the moaning of the wind as her mule-drawn cart clatters down the road.  Sounds of town guards drilling filter over the high wall of an armory to the north.
--------------------------------------------------
3454 [Tavern Burrow, Porter Street] Icemule Trace (u4042205)
  added description: Three shallow steps descend from the street toward the low doorway of a building, an armor shop if judging by the dark blue banner over the entrance.  The shop's crisply edged stucco walls have been painted steel grey, with white and black spirals accenting the swirls of the mortar.  Sets of armor, most designed to fit a diminutive frame, are on display through the wide bay windows.  A family pauses before the statue of a halfling standing opposite the door as the parents tell the hero's story to their children.
--------------------------------------------------
3458 [Tavern Burrow, Barley Lane] Icemule Trace (u4042217)
  added description: The lane turns sharply north, its forward progress blocked by a low stone well.  Attached to a length of frayed rope, the well's bucket has been hauled out of its depths.  Its wood looks to have been dry for some time.  Voices of parties heading home or to nearby taverns echo off of the brick facades of the narrow buildings to either side of the road, but the stretch is quieter than most of the surrounding district.

The cobbles of the road grow fewer as it approaches the yawning mouth of a burrow in the hillside, giving way to the crags of a stone floor several paces within.  Natural light manages little better before it is supplemented by the merry crackle of torches fed by pine pitch, the smell of which lingers on the wintry air.

Despite the torches' scant heat, immense icicles jut from the high ceiling, ornately carved into fanciful sculptures of sea beasts, including whales and sleek sharks.  A raised plaza sprawls at the lowest portion of the burrow's floor, the dark flagstones spiraling outward from a black marble statue.  A stained pine bench faces the monument, an old oaken tun at its side.

24434 [Ancient Burrow, Thaumaturgy Row] Icemule Trace (u4042258)
  added description: Nestled between a round black and blue door and a glaes-paned steel hatch, a natural recess in the stone has been transformed into an open air patio crowded with tables beneath hanging lanterns.  To one side of the passage, a small wooden cart is laden with fish freshly caught from the Frostmain.  As the ground begins to slant upwards, the cobblestones of the subterranean road grow smaller but no less numerous.
--------------------------------------------------
24439 [Ancient Burrow, Courtyard] Icemule Trace (u4042256)
  added description: The burrow's northern wall is of dark stone, and out of its face has been carved the facade of an imposing keep.  Occasional pitting and rivulets worn out of the facade by the patient efforts of dripping water suggest that the stonework is ancient.  The cobbles of the walk to the entrance are alternating black and white, forming peculiar patterns.  Sculptures of walruses and seals flank the path.
--------------------------------------------------
24440 [Ancient Burrow, Wiley Way] Icemule Trace (u4042259)
  added description: The natural stone ceiling overhead slopes downward as the underground road dwindles into a narrow corridor.  Nestled into the wall is an iron-bound spruce hatch framed by slim veins of black and white minerals that branch through the otherwise unremarkable stone of the wall.  Near a pair of cross-braced iron doors, a cylindrical skylight is carved vertically into the ceiling, offering limited lighting, but most of that duty is given over to pine pitch torches spaced along the way.  Hanging from one wall is a black tapestry embroidered with white snowflakes.
