683 [Sylvarraend, Mistglin Wey] the town of Sylvarraend (u13050013)
  added description: A small cottage with ivy-twined trellises faces an old dwelling across the trail, each equally tidy and charming.  While the facade of the first is a pleasant mingling of pinewood and maple, the other is composed of smooth river rock and mortar.  Each boasts a roof of thick red clay tiles, the eaves of which offer a convenient roosting place for local birds.

30026 [Eldurhaart, Altar of the Dragon] the Hinterwilds (u7503383)
  added description: Gilt scales glisten from the far wall of the hollow, picking out the sinuously muscled curves of a golden dragon depicted above a primitive altar of wrought iron and gilt.  Flames from the braziers at the hollow's perimeter reflect off of the surface of the metal, making the beast look as if it is writhing in the ruddy light.  A pair of solid golden double doors proceed beneath the dragon's spread wings.

32431 [Moonsedge, Gem Shop] Moonsedge (u4577057)
  added description: Paintings of fanciful trinkets and ostentatious adornments line the walls of the store, likely a mirror to the jewelry that once lined beds of black velvet near to the windows.  Not a trace of gold glistens within the looted shop.  Even the inlay on the counter has been pried free.  A sturdy modwir door in the rear of the shop is hacked and clawed, but stands fast, a testament to its sturdy wood.
