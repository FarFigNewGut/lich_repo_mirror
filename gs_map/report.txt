33964 [Haunted Waters Artifacts] -- new room
{"id"=>33964, "title"=>["[Haunted Waters Artifacts]"], "description"=>["Rotted hammocks sway from the exposed rafters of the room, the sodden rope and cloth structures dripping into stagnant pools upon the uneven ground.  Verdigris veins paint the copper portholes that gaze out into the streets beyond, their dirty windows limned in violet, cerulean, and coral hues as the perpetual twilight attempts to spill through the glass.  Footlockers, trunks, and barrels are scattered throughout the room, their warped faces mottled with bright white barnacles."], "paths"=>["Obvious exits: west"], "location"=>"Evermore Hollow", "wayto"=>{"33963"=>"west"}, "timeto"=>{"33963"=>0.2}, "uid"=>[8084806]}

{"id"=>33965, "title"=>["[A Vague Inkling, Showroom]"], "description"=>["Walls of pale grey stone enclose the spacious building, while thick rafters of oak support the layers of a compact thatched roof.  Partially covering the polished wooden floor is an oval braided rug mixed with a wide range of green.  Centered in the room is a live-edge maple table draped with a forest green velvet runner.  Next to a curtain-draped archway is a series of bronze hooks fashioned in the shape of various skeletal creatures."], "paths"=>["Obvious exits: out"], "location"=>"Evermore Hollow", "wayto"=>{"31621"=>"out"}, "timeto"=>{"31621"=>0.2}, "uid"=>[8084445]}
