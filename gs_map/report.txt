  added description: Following the curvature of the city's walls, the cobblestone street travels in a gentle incline to the north.  Columnar lampposts glisten in the daylight, the large frosted orbs that crown them dormant for the moment and temporary perches for migratory avians.  Brownstone homes are surrounded by small patchwork yards of dusky green centipede grass and maoral-framed herb or flower beds throughout this section of the city.
