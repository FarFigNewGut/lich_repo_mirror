{"id"=>35725, "title"=>["[Singing Crags, Wind Cave]"], "description"=>["Wind moans past the entrance of the cave, filling the narrow corridor with a low, reverberating moan as it descends into darkness.  Where the sun's light cannot reach, phosphorescent fungi flourish along the high stone walls, illuminating the path in eerie blues and unnatural greens.  The living curtains have almost entirely occluded primitive carvings etched crudely into the walls depicting upright beings with widespread wings and bloody appetites."], "paths"=>["Obvious exits: southeast, out"], "location"=>"Sailor's Grief", "wayto"=>{"35726"=>"southeast", "35715"=>"out"}, "timeto"=>{"35726"=>0.2, "35715"=>0.2}, "tags"=>["wind cave", "cave"], "uid"=>[7150329]}

35726 [Singing Crags, Altar of Wind] -- new room
{"id"=>35726, "title"=>["[Singing Crags, Altar of Wind]"], "description"=>["A towering idol of crudely carved stone stands with outstretched wings at the cave's end, features scantly lit by the phosphorescent fungi thriving in the moist darkness.  Warm, mineral-heavy water drips from above, trailing down the statue's face like tears.  Beneath its raised dais are heaped bowls of cracked porcelain and tarnished brass of a dozen different makes.  They are filled with ash and incense remnants alongside other offerings of fruit and stolen coin."], "paths"=>["Obvious paths: northwest"], "location"=>"Sailor's Grief", "wayto"=>{"35725"=>"northwest"}, "timeto"=>{"35725"=>0.2}, "tags"=>["idol", "altar of wind"], "uid"=>[7150330]}
