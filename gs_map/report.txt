Heavy, hole-ridden sheets of green velvet loosely cover a series of pristine wooden crates, the fabric pooling across the knitted rugs covering the dusty planks.  A pair of driftwood-carved sculptures flank a gilt-painted curio in the far corner, the open doors draped in a fine layer of brittle cobwebs."], "paths"=>["Obvious exits: down"], "location"=>"Bloodriven Village", "wayto"=>{"26907"=>"down"}, "timeto"=>{"26907"=>0.2}, "uid"=>[8212997]}
