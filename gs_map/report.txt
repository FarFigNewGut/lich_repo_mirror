  added description: Wrought iron lanterns sway overhead, the dancing flames casting light on a chair positioned behind a table, laden with charts, logbooks, and a map.  A bed is made up beneath an expansive window, the view interrupted by a rope dangling a bucket to help clean the glass panes.  A forgotten astrolabe lies near the door.
