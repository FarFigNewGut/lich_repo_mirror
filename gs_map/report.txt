30318 [Locksmehr River, Encampment] Bloodriven Village (u8214732)
  added description: Wending its way along the river's edge, a muddy trail slips through trampled grasses and various wild, thorny bushes that grow in profusion.  Built across the trail is a wide palisade of rough-hewn saplings and narrow tree poles that are lashed together with rawhide and hemp.  To the east, a small encampment occupies a bend in the river.

Inside each case rests a wing-shaped pin, some emitting a pale glow while others pulse with darker energy.  Subtle motes of light and shadow drift within the cases, occasionally brushing against the glass.
