A tall gnomish-crafted workbench dominates the center of the space.  Crystalline tubing snakes along the ceiling, carrying a faint azure glow from deeper in the ship, and hanging plants trail verdant tendrils from the tubing overhead.  A pile of jade-hued silk cushions  sits between the outer wall and a built-in verdigris copper brazier."], "paths"=>["Obvious exits: none"], "location"=>"The Black Rose, inside the elven fortress of Ta'Vaalor", "wayto"=>{"36162"=>"go bamboo door"}, "timeto"=>{"36162"=>0.2}, "uid"=>[2007508]}
