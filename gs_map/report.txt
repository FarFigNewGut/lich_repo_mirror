1139 [Locksmehr River, Wiley Island] the Locksmehr Trail (u13000053)
  added description: The river has cut its way through the forest as its waters rush down from the northern mountains towards Wehnimer's Landing.  Smooth boulders sticking out of the water and rough rapids deter any thoughts of trying to swim across the swiftly moving waters.  A wide rope bridge stretches west, over the river, and is secured around massive trees on both sides.

1142 [Locksmehr River, Rope Bridge] the Locksmehr Trail (u13000050)
  added description: Water sprays up into the air in all directions as it pounds the large boulders of the river below the bridge.  To the north, the river bends slightly as it comes down out of the mountains.  To the south it flows quickly around to the west towards Wehnimer's Landing.  The river has cut a wide swath through the lush forest, creating bluffs above the banks on either side of the rough rapids.

1143 [Locksmehr River Trail] the Locksmehr Trail (u13000049)
  added description: The trail opens into a small clearing, where several old, rotting logs line the muddy banks of the Locksmehr River.  A wide rope bridge stretches east, across the river, toward a narrow island in the center of the swiftly moving current.  Resting off to one side of the trail is a neat stack of wood.
