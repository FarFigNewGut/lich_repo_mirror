30789 [Enemy Ship, Quarters] The Tenebrous Cauldron (u)
  added description: Moonlight filters through a large, glass-paned window, illuminating a map spread out on a table in the center of the cabin.  A logbook lies open on a bed near a chair piled with freshly laundered garments.  Nautical charts are tacked to the oak-paneled walls, all scribbled with illegible handwriting, one drawn with a giant sea monster.
