13226 [Oleani's Temple, Prayer Garden] the town of Solhaven (u4749107)
  added description: On this side of the temple, tall hedges ring a small prayer garden, and white marble benches are scattered here and there for private moments of quiet contemplation.  Pink water lilies float in a small pool next to a slate-lined walkway leading behind the temple.  A wooden gate leads to the esplanade, while an arched modwir door leads into the temple.

13306 [Oleani's Temple, Wedding Bower] the town of Solhaven (u4749108)
  added description: High thuja hedges screen the city beyond the temple grounds from view, creating a small sanctuary in the bustling seaport.  Leading away from a gold-trimmed haon door, a white silk runner surrounded by verdant grass extends toward a rose-covered trellis that shelters a beautiful white marble statue.  A slate-lined walkway leads out of the bower, while a small grove of tanik trees leads to a pair of barely concealed cottages.
