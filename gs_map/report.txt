19311 [Willow Hall, Willow Tree] Willow Hall (u218016)
  added description: The bole of the monstrous willow is surrounded with a wealth of hanging garlands.  They obscure the existence of a small, shadowy enclave at the base of the tree near some louvered swinging doors, both curtained off by the tiny silver-backed leaves.  Soft moonlight filters through the boughs, leaving the silhouette of the branches as stark, black lines.  High up in the tree top, a circular construction is barely visible in the night's cloak of darkness.

In the center of the room is a massive polished table that appears to have grown from the floor.  Staff scurry back and forth under the watchful eyes of the head cook and the head baker, and some louvered swinging doors lead out."], "paths"=>["Obvious exits: none"], "location"=>"Willow Hall", "wayto"=>{"19311"=>"go doors"}, "timeto"=>{"19311"=>0.2}, "uid"=>[218060]}
