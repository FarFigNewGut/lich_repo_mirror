31573 [Gavelsdown Hall, Parlor] Evermore Hollow (u8084012)
title: [Gavelsdown Hall, Entry] is now [Gavelsdown Hall, Parlor]
  added description: Twilight hues spill through the open windows, giving the dimly light room a bruised appearance that is vivid contrast to the plush carpeting and gold fixtures.  High-backed leather armchairs are arranged in social circles throughout the space, while an elaborately carved cabinet occupies a space along the back wall.  The thick scent of cherry tobacco fills the air.
  removed description: Brightly illuminated by polished brass sconces that are evenly spaced upon the crimson and ebon bourde walls, the entry is carpeted with a deep burgundy rug that muffles all sound.  Flanked on the eastern wall by a lacquered ebonwood archway and the western by glass-paned doors, a flight of broad mahogany stairs ascends to the second floor and is decorated with carved balusters.

31576 [Gavelsdown Hall, Parlor East] Evermore Hollow (u8084014)
title: [Gavelsdown Hall, Sitting Room] is now [Gavelsdown Hall, Parlor East]
  added description: Twilight hues spill through the open windows, giving the dimly light room a bruised appearance that is vivid contrast to the plush carpeting and gold fixtures.  High-backed leather armchairs are arranged in social circles throughout the space, while an elaborately carved cabinet occupies a space along the back wall.  The thick scent of cherry tobacco fills the air.
  removed description: Hunter green and ebon bourde fabric decorates the walls of the sitting room, the colorful fabric threaded with thin gold wire that reflects the lights of the nearby scones.  Several settees of polished dark walnut are arranged through the space and covered with lush velveteen in complimentary hues.  A dark carpet stretches across the floor, its surface dappled in sodden footprints that trail to and from a pair of glass-paned doors.

32201 [Gavelsdown Hall, Parlor West] Evermore Hollow (u8084013)
title: [Gavelsdown Hall, Parlor] is now [Gavelsdown Hall, Parlor West]
  added description: Twilight hues spill through the open windows, giving the dimly light room a bruised appearance that is vivid contrast to the plush carpeting and gold fixtures.  High-backed leather armchairs are arranged in social circles throughout the space, while an elaborately carved cabinet occupies a space along the back wall.  The thick scent of cherry tobacco fills the air.
  removed description: Golden linden frames surround floor-to-ceiling windows upon the southern and western walls, the glass within whorled and opaque, causing only a dim impression of the natural light to filter through.  Curios and cupboards are scattered about the parlor, their lacquered faces glinting in the light of the room's sconces, while an elaborately carved cabinet is deliberately placed beneath a spotlight.  Offering egress, a lacquered ebonwood archway opens up the eastern wall.
