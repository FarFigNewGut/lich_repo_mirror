  added description: Beneath an uneven wooden ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the plain wooden walls.  An oversized sea chest sits in one corner while a worn rug rests on the wooden floor.
  removed description: Knotty oak-paneled walls rise from a varnished dark oak floor.  Just above a series of thinly woven rugs hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a wide-planked white cedar ceiling completes the picture.  A slender driftwood counter and a plank-covered barrel table stand side by side in the middle of the room.
