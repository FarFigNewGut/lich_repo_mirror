REQUIRES SCRIPT 'DANGER' TO RUN SAFELY
Hands free mining in one room.  Uses a packet, can start with 
pickaxe or shovel. can start with variables 'nograb' and 'shovel'.  
NOGRAB will simply mine out a node with your pickaxe and pick up 
any rares, shovel starts the script with a shovel instead of a 
pickaxe.  No variables will start with a pickaxe, swap to a shovel 
when metal appears, and stow any metal that drops.
