    Before running pick.lic for the first time, you MUST add a method for each of your characters which sets the following UserVars (change the values to match your needs):
        UserVars.lockpicking_armor = ['knuckles', 'mask', 'gloves', 'shield']
        # The name of the container holding the boxes that have not been attempted yet
        UserVars.box_source = "duffel bag"
        # The name of the container in which to put boxes that have a trap/lock too dificult to open
        # This should be different than box_source
        UserVars.box_storage = "backpack"
        # The type of lockpick to buy to refill your ring, if a ring is used
        UserVars.lockpick_type = "ordinary"

    Your new method MAY also need to override any UserVars set in baseline_setup.
    * Be sure not to change baseline_setup itself, as this is common to all characters.
    * See below for some example methods for various guilds.
