=begin

Will automatically stop you humming and start preping your spell if you are humming when you attempt to prep,
or will reattempt prep if in roundtime when you tried.

Will need to set alias prep=;prep.  But just remember in normal conversation to never use the word prep, always use prepare.

Also, I personally put ignore squelches of "---Lich: prep active." and "---Lich: prep has exited."
